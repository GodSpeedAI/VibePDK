# VibePDK Commercial License Agreement

**Version 1.0 — October 2025**

This Commercial License Agreement ("Agreement") is between **GodSpeed AI** ("Licensor") and the customer ("Licensee") for the **VibePDK** software system.

---

## 1. DEFINITIONS

* **"Software" or "VibePDK"** means the VibePDK software system, including all associated documentation, APIs, components, modules, and updates.

* **"Internal Use"** means use of VibePDK within an organization solely for that organization’s own operations, without making VibePDK’s functionality available to third parties.

* **"Output"** means any software, applications, or systems generated *by* VibePDK that operate independently of VibePDK (similar to artwork created in Photoshop).

* **"Redistribution"** means providing VibePDK itself (in whole or in part) to third parties, whether for free or for payment.

---

## 2. WHAT’S ALLOWED WITHOUT THIS LICENSE

Under the **MPL-2.0 open source license**, you may:

* **Internal Use:** Run and use VibePDK within your own organization for any purpose that does not involve providing VibePDK’s functionality to third parties.
* **Personal Use:** Run VibePDK for personal, educational, or reVibePDKrch purposes.
* **Output Ownership:** All software, applications, or systems generated *by* VibePDK are your property. You may use, license, or sell such Output without limitation, provided the Output does not include VibePDK itself.

---

## 3. WHAT REQUIRES THIS COMMERCIAL LICENSE

You must obtain a commercial license if you:

1. **Redistribute VibePDK**

   * Provide VibePDK itself (in whole or in part) to third parties.
   * Include VibePDK in a distributed product, software bundle, or appliance.

2. **Offer VibePDK as a Service**

   * Host VibePDK (or a derivative) for third parties via SaaS, cloud APIs, managed services, or similar.
   * Permit external users to directly or indirectly access VibePDK’s functionality.

3. **Rebrand or White-Label**

   * Market VibePDK or VibePDK-derived functionality as your own proprietary product or technology.

**Boundary Rule:** If third parties are interacting with VibePDK itself, you need a commercial license. If third parties are only using your Output (which operates independently of VibePDK), no commercial license is required.

## 4. THE PHOTOSHOP PRINCIPLE

Just as Adobe Photoshop users:

* Can use Photoshop internally without restriction
* Own their created artwork completely
* Cannot resell Photoshop itself
* Cannot offer "Photoshop-as-a-Service"

VibePDK users:

* Can use VibePDK internally without restriction

## 5. OUTPUT OWNERSHIP CLARIFICATION

* **Licensee’s Exclusive Rights:** All Output generated by Licensee using VibePDK is solely Licensee’s property.
* **Independence:** Output does not inherit any license obligations from VibePDK.
* **No VibePDK in Output:** This ownership only applies where Output does not include VibePDK code or components. If Output incorporates VibePDK itself, that portion remains subject to VibePDK’s license terms.

---

## 6. GRANT OF LICENSE (When Required)

* Fees are due in advance and are non-refundable.
