# Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code and prefer functional components in React.
- Follow naming conventions: PascalCase for component and type names, camelCase for variables and functions.
- Use Prettier/ESLint configuration (if present) to format code automatically. Ensure consistent indentation and spacing.
- Keep functions small and focused; avoid large monolithic functions.
- Use descriptive comments and JSDoc where helpful; avoid redundant comments.
- Reference the general coding guidelines in the `general.instructions.md` if additional context is required.
