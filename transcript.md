Improved Priming Prompt
<prompt> **Context Loading for DSL Design Task**
Objective: Prime your analytical frameworks with relevant design patterns, architectural concepts, and successful DSL examples to prepare for creating a comprehensive YAML-based prompt management system.
1. Architectural Patterns & Principles
Compositional Systems: Analyze how Docker Compose orchestrates containers through YAML declarations, Kubernetes manages resources via manifests, and GitHub Actions defines workflows. Focus on: hierarchical composition, dependency resolution, override mechanisms, and environment-specific configurations.
Modular Design: Consider how successful systems achieve modularity through: separation of concerns, interface boundaries, plugin architectures, and middleware patterns.

Analysis of Design Patterns and DSLs for Context-Aware Prompt Configuration

Part 1: Conceptual Frameworks for a Prompt-DSL Design
1. Architectural Patterns & Principles
Compositional Systems (Declarative Orchestration): Modern platforms use YAML to declare components and how they interconnect, allowing complex systems to be composed from simple parts. For example, Docker Compose defines multi-container applications with services, networks, and volumes in a single YAML file. Kubernetes Manifests declare desired cluster state (pods, deployments, services) in YAML; the system’s controller then works to make reality match the spec. GitHub Actions workflows similarly use YAML to orchestrate jobs and steps. A key strength is hierarchical and dependency-aware composition: users can describe what they want (containers running, tasks in sequence, etc.), and the tool resolves order and dependencies automatically
spacelift.io
charleswan111.medium.com
. These systems also support overrides and environment-specific configuration via file merging or variable interpolation, allowing one base configuration with small tweaks for different contexts (e.g. using docker-compose.override.yml for local changes). Modular Design and Separation of Concerns: Effective architectures isolate concerns into modules or plugins that interact through defined interfaces. Plugin systems (like VSCode extensions or Terraform providers) enable features to be added or removed without altering core code, by adhering to a contract. Middleware patterns (as in Express.js or ASP.NET pipeline) allow sequential processing layers – each component focuses on one aspect (logging, auth, etc.) and passes control onward. This yields flexible composition: features can be enabled, reordered, or swapped independently. Dependency injection (DI) complements modularity by decoupling module logic from the concrete implementations of their dependencies – modules receive needed components (interfaces) from an external injector, making swapping or testing components easier. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) further addresses cross-cutting concerns: it injects behaviors (e.g. logging, security checks) across different parts of an application without those parts explicitly invoking them. This increases modularity by separating such concerns from core business logic
gatographql.com
. In summary, the guiding principle is composition over inheritance – favor assembling behavior from modular components rather than deep class hierarchies. Inheritance (especially deep class trees) can lead to rigid structures and the fragile base class problem, whereas composition allows more flexible reuse by plugging together small, focused pieces. Inheritance vs. Composition Models: When inheritance is needed, shallow and clear hierarchies are preferred. Different paradigms illustrate trade-offs: Classical inheritance (as in Java/C++) provides is-a relationships and polymorphism but can encourage complexity if overused. Prototypal inheritance (JavaScript) offers more flexible extension at runtime but can be harder to reason about. Mixins/Traits (Ruby, Python) allow injecting methods into classes without formal inheritance, offering a middle ground for reuse. Many modern designs favor composition – assembling capabilities by including components – to avoid the brittleness of deep inheritance. Ultimately, a DSL should allow users to compose prompts or configurations (like building blocks) rather than forcing them into rigid hierarchies. Where hierarchy is needed (e.g. a base prompt template extended by others), it should be shallow and intuitive, similar to how Terraform modules can call other modules (one level down) or how OpenAPI components can inherit via allOf without deep class trees

2. Fine-Tuning & Model Adaptation Analogies
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA): LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that adds small trainable weight matrices (of low rank) to a pretrained model’s layers, rather than adjusting all weights
medium.com
. During training, only these small matrices (which represent the “delta” or adjustment to the original weights) are updated. This drastically reduces the number of parameters that need training (often <1% of the model’s weights
magazine.sebastianraschka.com
) while still achieving performance on par with full fine-tuning. A major advantage is that multiple LoRA adapters can be stacked or merged: one base model can have separate LoRA weight sets for different tasks, and they can be combined to compose skills. In fact, researchers have found that merging multiple LoRA adapters (e.g. for different tasks) into one model is feasible, enabling multi-task capabilities without retraining from scratch
arxiv.org
. This is analogous to stacking configuration layers: each LoRA adapter is like a modular patch that can be applied or removed as needed to change the model’s behavior. Adapter Layers in Transformers: Before LoRA, adapter modules were proposed (Houlsby et al. 2019) to achieve similar goals. Adapters insert small bottleneck layers within each transformer block; during fine-tuning, only those adapter weights train, while the rest of the model stays frozen
medium.com
magazine.sebastianraschka.com
. This yields an efficient way to toggle different behaviors – e.g. one set of adapter weights for legal text, another for scientific text – using the same base model. They can be swapped in and out like plugins. Notably, adapters trained for different tasks can also be merged or composed, akin to combining multiple configuration presets. Libraries like AdapterHub even support task arithmetic: linearly combining adapter parameters to blend or even subtract out certain behaviors
docs.adapterhub.ml
docs.adapterhub.ml
. These techniques mirror how a prompt DSL might allow layering multiple prompt snippets or skill modules together. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Paradigm: Both LoRA and adapters exemplify a broader principle: add only a small number of new parameters for each new capability. Only those new parameters are tuned, leaving the base model intact
magazine.sebastianraschka.com
. This is analogous to configuration-as-code in software: instead of forking and modifying an entire codebase for each new scenario, you supply a small config diff or plugin. The base remains unchanged and reusable, and changes are modular. “Configuration as Code” Benefits: Managing prompts and AI behaviors via configuration (like a YAML DSL) can draw lessons from Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). Treating configurations as code means you get version control (every change is tracked in Git, with history and diffs
spacelift.io
), enabling rollback of prompt changes and A/B testing of different versions easily
spacelift.io
. It also allows code review of prompts/instructions just like software, improving quality and catching errors. IaC practices emphasize reproducibility – the same config yields the same environment or behavior every time – which in our context means a given prompt config should produce a consistent AI behavior, enabling reliable testing. Automated validation and testing can be applied (e.g. a CI pipeline could lint the prompt YAML, run example queries against it, and ensure outputs meet expectations). Just as Terraform or Kubernetes configs can be jointly managed by teams, a prompt DSL in code form allows collaboration and sharing of best practices. Analogy – Versioning and Reusability: In fine-tuning, one base model can have many small adaptation weights saved for different purposes; switching or stacking them is easy without training a new model from scratch
medium.com
medium.com
. Similarly, a good prompt DSL could allow mixing and matching prompt components: e.g. a base system prompt plus one of several domain-specific blocks (legal, medical, etc.) composed as needed. The composition of weights in LoRA (W = W₀ + ΔW₁ + ΔW₂ ...) is akin to composing configuration layers in a DSL. This approach encourages modularity – you don’t create an entirely new prompt for each task; you assemble it from tested pieces, much like Terraform modules or Ansible roles.
3. Successful DSL Case Studies
Ansible Playbooks (YAML DSL for Automation): Ansible uses YAML playbooks to automate IT tasks declaratively. Key design features include: Roles and Includes – playbooks can be factored into roles (reusable units for, say, “install database”) with defaults, vars, and tasks, which can be composed together. Variable Precedence – Ansible defines a clear hierarchy for variables (inventory vars, role defaults, play vars, extra-vars, etc.) to determine which value wins when multiple sources provide the same key
spacelift.io
spacelift.io
. This ensures predictable overrides and allows sensible defaults that users can override if needed (paralleling convention-over-configuration). Templating – Jinja2 templates enable dynamic content (e.g. setting config files content based on variables). Idempotency – Modules and playbooks strive to be idempotent, meaning running them multiple times yields the same state without unintended changes
docs.ansible.com
. This is achieved by having tasks check the desired state before acting (e.g. only create a user if it doesn’t exist). Idempotency is crucial for reliability, and in a prompt DSL context, it’s analogous to ensuring that applying the same prompt config twice doesn’t produce contradictory setups. Ansible also emphasizes readability (“YAML with minimal syntax”) – something our DSL should emulate so that prompts are easy to reason about. Terraform’s HCL (Infrastructure DSL): Terraform’s HashiCorp Configuration Language is a domain-specific language for describing cloud infrastructure. It is declarative and emphasizes resource graphs and dependency resolution – you declare resources (VMs, networks, etc.) and Terraform builds a dependency graph to know what must be created before what
charleswan111.medium.com
. This allows parallelization and correct ordering without the user scripting it imperatively. The DSL supports modules as reusable components: groups of resources can be published as modules with inputs/outputs, enabling reuse across projects
scalr.com
scalr.com
. The HCL design balances simplicity with power: it allows basic expressions and conditionals, but not full general-purpose logic, to keep configs declarative. It uses providers (plugins for each platform, e.g. AWS, Azure) – an abstraction that separates the core language from platform-specific details. For our prompt DSL, we might envision providers or plugins for different model types or tools (e.g. a plugin to fetch context from a vector database, analogous to a Terraform provider). Terraform also manages state (tracking the last applied state to know diffs) and plans, giving a form of dry-run feedback. In a prompt DSL world, an analog might be validating a prompt configuration or showing a “plan” of how prompts will be combined before actually deploying it to an AI system. OpenAPI/Swagger (API Specification DSL): OpenAPI is a JSON/YAML DSL for REST API schemas. It uses a component system to maximize reuse and composability: common schemas for data objects are defined in a components section and referenced via $ref wherever needed, so that the API is consistent and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself). It also supports polymorphism and inheritance via allOf, oneOf, etc. – e.g. one schema can allOf include several others to compose a more complex schema
blog.stoplight.io
swagger.io
. This allows clear structuring (general definitions extended for specific cases) without repeating fields. Clear structure and validation are hallmarks: the OpenAPI DSL has a formal schema (itself defined in JSON Schema) so that tools can validate if your API spec is valid. The DSL is expressive enough to cover status codes, parameters, authentication requirements (with components for security schemes), etc., yet remains purely declarative. A successful prompt DSL may similarly need a way to reference or inherit components (e.g. a common prompt snippet that can be included in multiple prompts), and it would benefit from a strong schema for validation. The ecosystem around OpenAPI (editors, linters like Spectral, documentation generators, code generators for clients/servers) shows the advantage of a well-adopted DSL – it enables rich tooling. GraphQL Schemas: GraphQL uses a schema definition language (SDL) to define types, queries, mutations, etc. It emphasizes a strong type system and a clear, hierarchical structure of data. Notably, GraphQL supports directives – annotations on schema fields or queries that can alter execution or denote additional behavior (such as @deprecated or custom directives for auth). Directives act like aspects or middleware for fields, enabling cross-cutting behaviors (e.g. a caching directive that applies to many resolvers) in a modular way
gatographql.com
. The SDL’s design balances expressiveness and simplicity: it’s more concise than XML or JSON, and very human-readable, which is important given that developers frequently hand-write schema definitions. GraphQL’s introspection capability (a schema can describe itself) has enabled a huge tooling ecosystem: editors with autocomplete, schema linters, and code generators (for example, generating TypeScript types or query SDKs from the schema). This underscores the value of making a DSL that is self-descriptive and introspectable – a prompt DSL could include metadata or allow querying its structure, to support tools that visualize prompt flows or check compatibility with models. Ansible, Terraform, OpenAPI, GraphQL – Lessons: Across these examples, successful DSLs achieve a few common goals: They make typical use-cases simple (with sensible defaults and abstractions) but allow edge-case customization (through override hierarchies, escape hatches like custom plugins or directives). They enforce consistency (through schemas/types and predictable behavior), and they cultivate ecosystems of tools (linters, testers, generators) by having a clear specification. They also consider cognitive load: YAML or HCL are simpler for the target users than general-purpose languages, because they eliminate unnecessary syntax and capabilities. Our prompt DSL should aspire to the same – find the right level of abstraction so that using it feels easier than writing raw code, but it’s not so constrained that complex prompt scenarios are impossible to represent.
4. Prompt Engineering Taxonomy
Structural Prompt Patterns: In multi-turn conversational AI, prompts often have roles and structure. For instance, OpenAI APIs distinguish system messages (context/instructions for the assistant), user messages (queries/commands), and assistant messages (the AI’s replies). A robust prompt DSL should let users define such structured roles. There are patterns like few-shot prompting, where the prompt includes example exchanges (e.g. showing the AI how to respond by demonstration). The DSL might need constructs for embedding examples: think of a YAML list of examples each with a user input and desired assistant output. Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT) is another structural technique – instead of prompting the model for a direct answer, you prompt it to produce a step-by-step reasoning process before giving the final answer. CoT has been shown to significantly improve accuracy on complex reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps
ibm.com
. In a DSL, supporting CoT might mean allowing a prompt template that instructs the model to "think out loud" or perhaps splitting a task into multiple queries (a form of prompt chaining, below). Also important is role-based prompting, where the model is asked to adopt a persona or role (e.g. “You are a helpful coding assistant…”). Our DSL might include a field like role: "SQL expert" that automatically injects a system prompt to shape the assistant’s style and knowledge. Compositional Prompt Techniques: Complex tasks often benefit from breaking prompting into parts. Prompt chaining involves feeding the output of one prompt into the next – a sequence of prompt steps to tackle sub-tasks one by one
ibm.com
. A DSL could represent this as a list of steps, each with its own prompt and handling of previous answers (like a workflow). Conditional prompting might change the next prompt based on the model’s prior answer (for example, if the answer seems uncertain, ask a follow-up). This edges into imperative logic, which YAML alone doesn’t handle, but a DSL could incorporate simple conditionals or references to prior results. Context injection / Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): this pattern fetches external context (from documents, knowledge bases) relevant to the user’s query and inserts it into the prompt. The DSL could have a section for context: which might reference an external data source or a vector search. The key is to separate what to retrieve from how to inject it. Perhaps the DSL could allow declaring a context source (like “use documentation XYZ for functions”) and then automatically include the retrieved snippets into the final prompt at execution time. By formalizing this, you ensure every run uses the same retrieval method, which improves reproducibility. Meta-Instructions and Parameters: These are settings that influence how the model generates output, rather than the content of the prompt itself. Examples: temperature, which controls randomness/creativity of the output (high temperature = more varied and creative, low = more deterministic)
community.openai.com
; max_tokens, the limit on output length to avoid runaway answers. A DSL should let users specify such generation parameters declaratively for each prompt or step. Similarly, stop sequences can be specified to tell the model when to stop (e.g. stop: "\n\n" to stop at a double newline) – this is important to control output format (like ending at end of an answer list)
help.openai.com
. Other meta-instructions include output format specifications (e.g. “answer in JSON” or “provide a list of bullet points”), which could be part of the content prompt but might be nice to have as structured hints (like a DSL field format: JSON that the system knows to enforce or verify). Safety and guardrails: e.g. instructing the model about disallowed content or to follow certain policies. In current OpenAI usage, these are often put in the system prompt (“If the user asks for X, refuse.”). A DSL could have a section for safety or compliance instructions that are automatically prepended to prompts. By making them explicit, one could toggle different safety profiles easily or ensure they’re always present for certain deployments. Evaluation Hooks: Once prompts are executed, especially in a development or experiment setting, one might want to evaluate the quality or behavior of the responses. The DSL or its ecosystem could support this in several ways: A/B testing – you might run two different prompt variants (say, two versions of instructions) against the same set of test queries to compare outcomes. A DSL configuration could include multiple prompt alternatives marked with identifiers and a way to route traffic or test cases to them. Metrics and logging – capturing tokens used, latency, or user ratings of the answers. While not part of the prompt syntax per se, it’s related: the system using the DSL can log these for each prompt run. Bias or safety detection – e.g. after the model responds, run an automated check for certain problematic words or use a classification model to flag bias/offensive content. In a DSL context, perhaps one could specify hooks like “after each response, run it through a toxicity filter model X” as part of the workflow. Quality scoring – Another pattern is to employ an LLM to judge the output (for example, using a separate prompt: “Score the above answer for accuracy and completeness on 1-5”). The DSL could facilitate this by allowing multi-step prompts where the final step is a evaluation prompt that reads the prior answer. In essence, the DSL should not only define prompt generation, but also could define post-processing or validation steps. This ensures prompt engineering isn’t done in isolation but as part of a loop where outputs are measured. All these prompt-engineering patterns underscore that our DSL must be flexible in representing multi-part interactions, parameterization, and integration with external logic (retrieval, post-checks), while still being user-friendly and high-level.
5. Cognitive Ergonomics Principles
Designing a DSL isn’t just about raw capability – it’s also about usability and reducing cognitive load on users.
Progressive Disclosure: Simple tasks should be simple; complex tasks should be possible. The DSL should present a simple interface for simple prompts, without making the user wade through boilerplate. Only when needed should the user be exposed to additional complexity. This is akin to UI design where advanced settings are hidden under an “Advanced” menu. In our context, a basic single-prompt might only require a few lines (model name, prompt text), whereas a complex multi-step chained prompt with conditionals might unlock additional YAML sections or require more fields. By deferring advanced features to when they’re needed, the DSL remains approachable. This principle is important to avoid scaring off new users with an overly complex required structure. (It parallels Jakob Nielsen’s concept of progressive disclosure in UX, which defers rarely used features to secondary screens to keep the primary interface easy to learn
nngroup.com
nngroup.com
.)
Convention over Configuration: Wherever possible, have sensible defaults so that the user doesn’t have to specify things the DSL can assume. For example, if the DSL knows the default model is GPT-4 and default format is a plain text answer, those shouldn’t need to be repeated unless changed. Common prompt guidelines (like “Always end with an answer”) could be built-in conventions. This idea, borrowed from frameworks like Ruby on Rails, significantly reduces how much a user must write. The DSL can assume defaults but always provide a way to override. “Systems should assume reasonable defaults... and just work, allowing overrides only when needed.”
books.sonatype.com
. This gives users a predictable starting point and lowers the learning curve – they only specify what diverges from the norm.
Predictable Mental Models: The DSL’s structure and naming should align with users’ intuition. Clear hierarchies (maybe sections like system_prompt:, user_prompt:, steps:, etc.) and consistent terminology ensure that a user can guess how to do something new by analogy to what they already learned. If similar concepts appear in different parts of the DSL, they should use the same keywords or format. For instance, if we use variables: to define placeholders in a prompt, use that everywhere, rather than sometimes calling it params elsewhere. A consistent mental model also means that the execution of the DSL should match expectations – e.g. if the DSL says two steps are sequential, users expect step 2 sees step 1’s output. Surprises or “gotchas” in how it works will hurt adoption. Drawing parallels to known DSLs can help (for example, users familiar with GitHub Actions might find it natural if our DSL represents steps and uses a similar syntax for if-conditions). Ultimately, we want the DSL to feel transparent – the user feels they understand what the system will do with their configuration.
Error Prevention and Clarity: Providing a strong schema and validation for the DSL will help catch errors early. For example, if a user writes a prompt step but forgets to give it a id or some required field, the tooling should flag that before execution. Similarly, if they reference a variable or context that doesn’t exist, a validator can warn. Clear error messages are essential: if a prompt fails to execute because, say, the model name was wrong or a step’s reference was invalid, the DSL engine should report something like “Unknown model ‘GPT-5’ at path .model” or “Step 3 references output of step 5, which doesn’t exist.” Schema validation (possibly via JSON Schema for the YAML) can enforce types (e.g. temperature must be between 0 and 1) and allowed values. This is analogous to how OpenAPI or Terraform validate config – errors are caught before anything is run. Also, providing explanations or hints in error messages can guide users (for example, if they use an unknown key, suggest the closest valid keys by name similarity). By preventing and quickly pinpointing mistakes, we reduce user frustration and build trust in the DSL.
In summary, the DSL should be designed not just for machine interpretability but for human usability. Defaults and conventions cover the common cases, consistent structure aids learning and recall, and robust validation covers the safety net for mistakes. We want users to focus on what they want the AI to do, not on wrestling with the DSL syntax or semantics.
Key Questions & Considerations
Overcoming YAML’s Limitations: YAML is great for static data configuration, but it lacks built-in logic or functions. How do we enable abstraction or reuse in a YAML-based DSL? Possibilities include using YAML anchors/aliases for reuse of blocks, supporting a pre-processing step (like Jinja2 templates in Ansible or Helm charts in Kubernetes) to allow some logic (loops, ifs) before yielding final YAML, or designing the DSL such that what would be “functions” are instead higher-level constructs (for example, a include_prompt: file.yml to reuse a snippet defined elsewhere). Another approach is embedding a minimal expression language for simple computations or conditions (similar to how GitHub Actions uses ${{ }} for expressions). The challenge is to keep the DSL declarative and simple, while not making it so rigid that users resort to copy-pasting large chunks due to no abstraction. A balance might be macro-like capabilities or the ability to parameterize prompt components (e.g. define a reusable prompt template with placeholders that can be filled by different values in different scenarios).
Metadata for Versioning and Performance: As this DSL will be used to fine-tune or configure AI behavior, it should carry metadata for each prompt or configuration. This could include a version number or name for the prompt preset (allowing tracking of changes over time and rollback to older prompt versions, similar to software versioning). Compatibility information could be useful – e.g. which model or model version this prompt was designed or tested for (since prompts might be tuned for GPT-4 vs a future GPT-5). Performance metadata might include results of evaluation: maybe the DSL supports including tags like expected_quality: 0.95 or links to test results. This is speculative, but having a section for documentation metadata can greatly help in managing prompts at scale (just like code modules have README or docstrings). Also, when fine-tuning LoRA or adapters are involved, metadata linking a prompt config to a particular LoRA weight ID or checksum could be important (ensuring the right fine-tuning is applied with the prompt). In essence, think of a prompt configuration as an artifact – we might want to annotate it with who created it, when, for what purpose, and any relevant metrics or notes (all under a metadata: key that doesn’t affect execution).
Declarative vs Imperative Blend: The DSL is primarily declarative (describing what the prompt flow is). But certain prompt flows have an imperative flavor – e.g. “if user asks X, do Y else do Z” or looping until a condition is met. Pure YAML can’t express loops or conditionals naturally. One option is to allow limited imperative constructs in a controlled way. For example, a step could have a condition field like when: answer.contains('RERUN') to simulate a conditional branch (similar to Ansible’s when or GitHub Actions’ if). Another approach: provide an imperative mode (like a scripting glue around the YAML) for advanced cases, but keep the YAML itself declarative. Since the objective is to manage prompts, many use cases might be handled with declarative composition (listing a sequence of steps which is inherently executed in order, which is a form of imperative sequence but declared declaratively). The key question is how far to go – we should avoid turning the DSL into a full programming language (that’s a high cognitive load), but we want enough control for complex interactions. Perhaps the answer is to integrate with actual code when needed: e.g. allow a step that calls a Python function or JavaScript snippet if truly complex logic is needed, rather than force logic into YAML. That way the YAML stays mostly declarative, and imperative logic lives in proper code when necessary (this is analogous to how GitHub Actions allows calling an external script).
Tooling and Ecosystem Enablement: A DSL doesn’t live in isolation – we want tools that make it easier to use. From the get-go, we should define a JSON Schema or similar for the DSL so that editors can autocomplete and validate documents. A VSCode extension for the prompt DSL could highlight errors, offer snippets for common patterns, etc. Linters can be built to enforce best practices (for example, warning if a prompt step has no stop sequence or if an example is missing an expected field, similar to ansible-lint or Spectral for OpenAPI). Code generation or templates might be possible – e.g. generate a skeleton DSL file for a certain pattern (a chain-of-thought prompt template generator). Also, a visualizer could be extremely helpful: since prompts can be multi-step, a tool that draws a flowchart of the prompt chain or a diagram of which context is injected where would aid understanding. Testing frameworks could read the DSL and run predefined test questions through it, asserting on the responses (somewhat like unit tests for prompts). By considering these tools early, we can design the DSL to be easily machine-readable and introspectable. For example, making sure each step has a clear identifier means logs and visualizations can refer to “Step 2: Summary step”. The DSL should also facilitate collaboration: storing it in Git, perhaps splitting large configurations into included files for modularity, etc., so multiple people can work on different prompts without merge conflicts. Essentially, a whole ecosystem similar to what exists for code should grow around prompt configurations.
Finally, ensure that the design patterns and analogies we’ve analyzed are reflected in the DSL’s design. We aim to create a language that allows modular, composable, and declarative definition of AI assistant behaviors, much as these successful systems have done for their domains. With this strong conceptual foundation, we can proceed to Part 2, where we will propose a concrete design of the YAML-based prompt management DSL, applying these principles and patterns. The goal will be to balance expressiveness (able to model complex prompt logic) with simplicity (keeping the cognitive load low), enabling users to reliably configure and fine-tune AI assistants with confidence and ease.

Here’s the completed modular AI prompt‑management system. All functionality relies solely on native GitHub Copilot and VS Code mechanisms—no custom DSL or YAML files. Key elements:

Instructions and prompts: Repository‑wide guidance in .github/copilot‑instructions.md plus MECE‑organized instruction files (general, security, performance, style, context) under .github/instructions. Prompt templates (e.g., create‑react‑component, security‑review, performance‑analysis) live in .github/prompts and include frontmatter metadata, context variables like ${fileBasename}, and links to the instruction files
code.visualstudio.com
code.visualstudio.com
.

Native settings: .vscode/settings.json enables prompt and instruction files, configures discovery locations, disables the unsafe chat.tools.autoApprove setting to block prompt‑injection attacks
embracethered.com
, and respects workspace trust
code.visualstudio.com
. A sample mcp.json shows secure MCP server configuration using environment variables
code.visualstudio.com
.

Automation: tasks.json defines tasks to run each prompt, measure approximate token usage, and perform A/B testing. Simple bash scripts in scripts/ demonstrate how to invoke the VS Code Copilot CLI or API and count tokens.

Documentation: A comprehensive README explains how to compose instruction files (LoRA‑style stacking), how to chain and reuse prompt files, and how to implement dynamic prompt injection, conditional loading, A/B testing, and hot‑reloading without YAML
code.visualstudio.com
code.visualstudio.com
. A migration guide details how to convert YAML‑based prompt DSLs into this native format.

You can download the complete implementation here: prompt-management-system.zip Extract it into a repository and open the folder in VS Code; all settings, instructions, prompts, tasks, scripts and documentation will be ready to use.

You said:
it didn't include custom chat modes
ChatGPT said:

Worked for 2 minutes
You're right—custom chat modes weren't included in the first version. I’ve added a dedicated .github/chatmodes folder with two example .chatmode.md files. Each mode file follows the structure documented by VS Code—front‑matter with description, tools and model, followed by a body of instructions
code.visualstudio.com
. To ensure VS Code discovers them, I updated settings.json to include chat.modeFilesLocations pointing at .github/chatmodes
code.visualstudio.com
. The README now explains how to create and use chat modes, and the migration guide maps YAML “roles” to chat modes.

The new chat modes are:

DevOps Audit Mode: asks the user to select a target file or folder, then performs a combined security and performance audit by applying the appropriate instruction files and summarises findings without making edits.

Planning Mode: guides the AI to produce a structured implementation or refactoring plan with overview, requirements, implementation steps and testing strategy.

All other components remain unchanged (instruction files, prompt files, tasks, scripts, MCP sample, and docs), but now the system supports selecting personas directly from the chat UI.

Here’s the updated project archive with custom chat modes included: prompt-management-system-updated.zip

Let me know if you’d like to add more chat modes or further customise the existing ones!

ChatGPT said:

Worked for 5 minutes
Below is the improved implementation brief. It expands the original task by adding eight new chat modes corresponding to the categories from the “My NEW 8‑Step Method” source (Elevator Pitch, Problem Statement, Target Audience, USP, Target Platforms, Features List, UX/UI Considerations and Non‑Functional Requirements). Each new mode is paired with the appropriate instruction files and integrates synergistically with the existing DevOps Audit and Planning modes. The deliverables remain YAML‑free and rely solely on native GitHub Copilot and VS Code mechanisms.

Improved Implementation Prompt
Role: Act as a Senior DevOps AI Engineer specializing in:

GitHub Copilot configuration and customization

VS Code extension development and workspace optimization

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) patterns

Developer experience (DX) automation

Security‑first configuration management

Objective: Design and implement a modular AI prompt‑management system using only native GitHub Copilot and VS Code configuration mechanisms—no external YAML DSL. In addition to prompts and instructions, you will define custom chat modes that map to the eight sections in the “My NEW 8‑Step Method” (Elevator Pitch, Problem Statement, Target Audience, Unique Selling Proposition, Target Platforms, Features List, UX/UI Considerations, and Non‑Functional Requirements). These modes must operate synergistically with the existing DevOps Audit and Planning modes to create a holistic product‑design workflow.

Context: Leverage existing GitHub Copilot infrastructure to create a composable, version‑controlled prompt‑engineering framework that exploits:

.github/copilot-instructions.md for repository‑wide guidance

.github/instructions/*.instructions.md for modular, MECE‑organised instruction components

.github/prompts/*.prompt.md for reusable prompt templates

.github/chatmodes/*.chatmode.md for custom chat personas (including the eight new modes, DevOps Audit, and Planning)

.vscode/settings.json for workspace‑level configuration (prompt and instruction discovery, chat mode locations, workspace trust and security)

.vscode/mcp.json for Model Context Protocol (MCP) settings

VS Code tasks for automation, chaining and A/B testing

Task: Create a comprehensive implementation that:

Exploits Native Capabilities

Use undocumented features and edge behaviours where beneficial.

Chain multiple configuration files for cascading effects.

Use chat.promptFilesLocations and chat.modeFilesLocations settings for dynamic discovery.

Respect workspace trust boundaries for security isolation.

Implements Modular Architecture

Design MECE instruction components (security, performance, style, context, etc.).

Achieve inheritance‑like behaviour through file naming conventions and load order.

Use symbolic links and workspace folders for composition patterns.

Implement “LoRA‑style” stacking via multiple instruction file combinations.

Defines and Integrates Chat Modes

Create eight chat modes (Elevator Pitch, Problem Statement, Target Audience, USP, Target Platforms, Features List, UX/UI Considerations, Non‑Functional Requirements).

Pair each mode with the appropriate instruction files (e.g., security, performance, style) and ensure they complement the existing DevOps Audit and Planning modes.

Where overlaps or conflicts arise (e.g., security vs. performance), integrate guidance synergistically rather than duplicating or contradicting.

Update the Planning mode to synthesise outputs from all eight modes, and refine DevOps Audit to incorporate non‑functional requirements when relevant.

Enables Advanced Patterns

Implement dynamic prompt injection via VS Code tasks.

Optimise context windows through strategic file ordering.

Provide conditional loading based on workspace settings.

Support A/B testing through Git branches and workspace switching.

Enable hot‑reloading of instructions without restarting VS Code.

Secures and Optimises Performance

Implement defences against prompt‑injection vulnerabilities such as disabling chat.tools.autoApprove
embracethered.com
.

Use .vscode/settings.json scoping for environment‑specific configurations
code.visualstudio.com
.

Create performance baselines via task automation and token‑usage monitoring.

Ensure that non‑functional requirements (scalability, security, accessibility) are captured through the Non‑Functional Requirements chat mode and enforced via instructions.

Deliverables

A complete repository structure with example implementations (instructions, prompts, chat modes, settings, tasks, and scripts).

VS Code workspace configuration templates including settings.json and mcp.json.

Task definitions for running prompts, chaining them, measuring tokens and A/B testing.

Documentation describing exploitation techniques, best practices and the synergy between chat modes.

A migration guide from YAML‑based systems.

All files must be immediately usable without additional tooling and provide clear advantages over traditional YAML‑driven prompt management approaches.

Constraints

Do not create any custom YAML files or external DSLs.

Use only native VS Code and GitHub Copilot configuration files (Markdown, JSON, scripts).

Solutions must run in an untrusted workspace only after explicit user approval.

The system must improve upon conventional prompt‑management methods in terms of modularity, security and developer experience.

Final Deliverable
Here is the completed repository implementing the improved design, including the eight new chat modes and synergy with DevOps Audit and Planning. Extract this archive into your project to use the prompt‑management system:

Contextual Foundation for Architecture-as-Code and System Generation

Preparation for DSL Design: Frameworks, Patterns, and Case Studies
1. Architectural Patterns & Principles
YAML-Based Composition (Docker Compose & Kubernetes): Docker Compose uses YAML for declarative multi-component configuration, allowing hierarchical composition and overrides via multiple files. A base compose.yaml is layered with environment-specific overrides (e.g. compose.override.yaml) — matching fields override defaults, while new fields merge in
docs.docker.com
docs.docker.com
. This lets simple use-cases work out-of-the-box, yet allows advanced users to override settings per environment (dev/staging/prod) without modifying the base config
docs.docker.com

. Kubernetes manifests similarly declare the desired state of resources in YAML; tools like Kustomize provide overlay/patch files to override base manifests for different environments (applying environment-specific diffs without duplicating entire files)
medium.com
medium.com
. This approach of layering configurations yields hierarchical composition and dependency resolution (e.g. K8s controllers ensure a Deployment’s pods exist to match the spec
kubernetes.io
kubernetes.io
). YAML’s declarative nature here simplifies complex behaviors by describing what to run, while the system (Compose, K8s) figures out how to orchestrate it, including dependency order (e.g. container links or K8s object refs).
Workflow Orchestration (GitHub Actions): GitHub Actions uses YAML to define workflows of jobs with explicit dependencies. Each job can specify needs: [job1, job2] to only run after those jobs succeed
docs.github.com
docs.github.com
, letting users declaratively encode complex pipelines without scripting control flow. Environment-specific configurations can be handled via matrix builds or job-level env overrides (a job can override a workflow’s defaults)
docs.github.com
. This shows how a DSL can provide dependency injection at the config level: instead of imperative scripts waiting on prior tasks, the YAML model has the system enforce order based on the declared graph. The YAML also allows override mechanisms in context (e.g. an env var set at the job level overrides a global env of the same name
docs.github.com
). In sum, GH Actions demonstrates how a declarative DSL can manage concurrency, dependencies, and conditional execution (with if conditions in YAML) for complex workflows

Modular & Plugin Architectures: Successful systems favor composition over inheritance to maximize modularity. For instance, Express.js middleware shows how separating concerns into pipeline components yields flexibility: each middleware function handles one concern (logging, auth, etc.) and passes control to the next, allowing clean separation and reuse
medium.com
. This pattern is essentially a plugin chain at runtime. Similarly, VSCode extensions or Webpack plugins/loaders expose hook APIs where independent modules can register to extend functionality. Webpack’s plugin system, for example, lets third-party code tap into the build lifecycle via well-defined hooks
webpack.js.org
webpack.js.org
 – enabling rich ecosystems without modifying core code. This illustrates the value of a DSL (or API) with clear extension points and inversion of control, so new behaviors can be “plugged in” declaratively (e.g. listing a plugin in a config file)
webpack.js.org
webpack.js.org
. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) offers another analog: it allows injecting cross-cutting behaviors (logging, security) via declarative aspects rather than hard-coding them, thereby modularizing concerns that span components
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. The takeaway for DSL design is to enable cross-cutting configurations (like global rules or filters) that can apply across different prompt components without repetition – akin to aspects or middleware that the DSL runtime weaves into the execution.
Inheritance vs. Composition in DSL Design: Traditional inheritance (class hierarchies in OOP) can increase complexity and tight coupling, whereas composition fosters flexibility by assembling pieces. Many modern config DSLs avoid deep inheritance in favor of hierarchical composition (as seen in Compose files or Terraform modules). Even when inheritance-like behavior is needed, it’s often shallow: e.g., Docker Compose’s extends keyword allows one service config to extend another’s base settings with overrides
docs.docker.com
docs.docker.com
. For DSLs, this suggests using mixins or include mechanisms rather than complex inheritance trees, to keep the structure understandable. If inheritance is used, it should be transparent – for example, OpenAPI uses allOf to let one schema “inherit” fields from another (essentially composition of schemas)
swagger.io
swagger.io
, rather than an opaque class hierarchy. The goal is a clear mental model: users see that one entity includes another’s properties (or one prompt includes another’s template) rather than having to chase an inheritance chain. This clarity echoes the “principle of least astonishment” – the DSL’s behavior should match user expectations and defaults (conventions) unless explicitly overridden
en.wikipedia.org
.
2. Fine-Tuning & Model Adaptation Analogies
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and Modularity: LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that injects small trainable weight matrices (low-rank decompositions) into a pre-trained model
magazine.sebastianraschka.com
magazine.sebastianraschka.com
. Think of the original model as fixed, and LoRA adds “patch” matrices $A$ and $B$ such that during inference, output = base_weight + B * A (scaled) composes the adapted behavior
magazine.sebastianraschka.com
magazine.sebastianraschka.com
. Crucially, multiple LoRA adapters can be stacked or combined: one can train separate LoRA modules for different tasks and merge them into the model sequentially
magazine.sebastianraschka.com
. This composability is analogous to layers of configuration in a DSL – just as LoRA lets you apply several independent adaptations to achieve a combined effect
magazine.sebastianraschka.com
magazine.sebastianraschka.com
, a well-designed prompt DSL could let users stack multiple modifications (e.g. layers of domain-specific instructions or stylistic tweaks). LoRA also enables reusing a base with different add-ons (like plugins): you don’t copy the whole model for each task, you attach small adapters. In our DSL, we might similarly attach small reusable prompt components (sub-prompts) to a base prompt for different objectives.
Adapter Layers and Parameter-Efficient Tuning: Beyond LoRA, the adapter pattern in NLP fine-tuning inserts small adapter modules into each transformer layer, rather than modifying core weights
ibm.com
ibm.com
. These adapters (e.g. small feed-forward layers) capture task-specific behavior and can be turned on or off per task. The pre-trained base remains unchanged, preserving prior knowledge (no catastrophic forgetting
ibm.com
), and adapters for multiple tasks can coexist (one model, many behaviors). This is analogous to a DSL that supports contextual or role-specific modules: e.g., one could enable a “QA adapter” vs. a “coding assistant adapter” in the prompt by including different YAML blocks, without rewriting the entire prompt from scratch. Parameter-efficient methods underline modularity and reusability – only a few parameters change per task
ibm.com
ibm.com
, akin to only tweaking certain sections of a prompt for different use-cases while the majority of the configuration stays constant.
Configuration-as-Code & DevOps Parallels: The idea of treating configurations (or prompts) as code brings proven benefits: version control, testing, and reproducibility
devops.com
devops.com
. Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, CloudFormation) shows that a declarative config can be checked into Git, code-reviewed, subjected to automated tests (linting, validate, plan), and rolled back if needed. By designing our prompt DSL with a formal schema and treating prompts as code artifacts, we get traceability (who changed what prompt, when, and why), and the ability to apply CI/CD practices (e.g. validating that a prompt meets certain guidelines or doesn’t produce regressions in output quality). Just as Terraform plans changes against current state to prevent unexpected infra drift, a prompt DSL could include a testing mode to preview model behavior changes when a prompt is adjusted. Furthermore, shared libraries of prompt components (similar to Terraform modules or Ansible roles) could be versioned and reused across projects, ensuring consistency. The principle is that declarative simplicity in configuration goes hand-in-hand with robust tooling: a clear YAML schema can be automatically validated, and because it’s human-readable, diffs are meaningful for reviewers
devops.com
devops.com
. In short, managing prompts via code enables systematic improvement and reliability, much as DevOps practices improved infrastructure management.
Composing Model Behaviors: Fine-tuning analogies also suggest the DSL could allow mix-and-match of capabilities. For example, LoRA research indicates you can merge multiple fine-tunings (e.g. add domain knowledge and add instruction-following) by summing their deltas
magazine.sebastianraschka.com
. Similarly, our DSL might allow merging prompt fragments – e.g., import a YAML snippet that encapsulates “expert tone” and another that adds “step-by-step reasoning instructions,” combining them in one prompt. This modular composition would let users build complex prompt behaviors from simpler, tested pieces (just as one might stack multiple adapters or LoRAs without retraining the whole model each time). The LoRA approach of non-destructive overrides – keeping base weights frozen – aligns with an idea of non-destructive prompt augmentation: the base prompt (core instructions) remain, and additional YAML sections augment behavior without overriding unless necessary (respecting defaults and only changing what’s needed, much like config overlays).
3. Successful DSL Case Studies
Terraform’s HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language): Terraform’s DSL shows how to balance expressiveness with cognitive load in describing infrastructure. HCL is declarative – you define resources (like “an AWS Instance”) with desired settings, and Terraform computes the plan to achieve it. Key design choices include a resource graph (Terraform infers dependencies between resources by analyzing references, so it knows what must be created before what) and a module system for composition
scalr.com
scalr.com
. Modules let you group resources and variables into reusable units, essentially allowing abstraction and reuse in the DSL. For example, a module can encapsulate a VPC setup; users can instantiate that module with different parameters for prod vs dev. HCL also emphasizes sensible defaults – a lot of configuration is optional because the system has conventions (e.g. naming, unless you override)
en.wikipedia.org
. This is “convention over configuration” in action: only specify the unusual cases, and let defaults cover the rest. The result is less cognitive burden on the user for common scenarios. HCL is designed to be human-readable (similar to YAML in spirit but with a bit more structure and typing)
scalr.com
scalr.com
, and it includes expressions and functions for mild logic (without turning into a general-purpose language). The success of Terraform’s DSL also owes to the tooling ecosystem: linters, terraform fmt for consistent formatting, plan for previews, state management backends, etc. A takeaway is that a DSL should have a clear core syntax that’s easy to read/write, support modularity (our prompt DSL should allow including or referencing other prompt pieces), and have strong tooling (maybe a linter to catch ambiguous phrasing or a tester to simulate outputs). HCL’s approach to state (keeping track of deployed resources) might translate to our DSL as keeping track of conversation state or prompt history in a structured way.
Ansible Playbooks (YAML DSL): Ansible uses YAML playbooks to orchestrate IT automation, and its design offers lessons in organization, override, and idempotence. Playbooks are structured in plays -> tasks -> modules, providing a clear hierarchy of what runs where
docs.ansible.com
docs.ansible.com
. Ansible introduced roles as a way to package related tasks, defaults, and handlers for reuse across playbooks
redhat.com
redhat.com
. This role system is essentially a way to achieve composition and inheritance of behavior: a role can be seen as a template for a set of tasks, which you can include in different playbooks (possibly overriding default variables). Crucially, Ansible has a well-defined variable precedence system – variables can be defined in many places (inventory, playbook, role defaults, etc.), and Ansible specifies which ones win if there are conflicts
docs.ansible.com
. This prevents ambiguity and gives users mental rules to predict outcomes. Our prompt DSL might likewise need clear rules for overrides (e.g. if the same parameter is set at multiple levels, which takes priority?). Another key Ansible principle is idempotency: modules are written so that running them twice won’t change the system the second time if it’s already in desired state
docs.ansible.com
. In a prompt context, this could translate to designing prompt modules (or functions) that don’t accidentally compound effects if applied multiple times – or providing mechanisms to avoid repeating the same hint twice. Finally, Ansible’s use of YAML shows how a declarative format can drive imperative actions under the hood, and how templating can be integrated (Jinja2 templates allow dynamic content in YAML). For our DSL, allowing placeholders that get filled in (like user inputs or contextual data) would add power, analogous to Ansible’s variables in playbooks.
OpenAPI/Swagger (Declarative API Schemas): OpenAPI Specification is essentially a DSL (in JSON/YAML) for describing REST APIs, and it illustrates schema composition and reuse principles. OpenAPI allows defining components (schemas, parameters, responses) that can be referenced via $ref from multiple places, avoiding duplication. For example, you can define a data model once and reuse it in many endpoints. It also supports combining schemas with constructs like allOf, oneOf, anyOf to express inheritance or union types
swagger.io
swagger.io
. The allOf keyword effectively lets you extend a base schema by adding more fields, akin to class inheritance but in a declarative manner
swagger.io
swagger.io
. This demonstrates a way to provide clear inheritance/composition in a YAML DSL – it’s explicit (you can see all the pieces that form the whole), and it’s validated by tools so you know if your combination is valid. OpenAPI also shows how to balance complexity: simple APIs can be described with straightforward paths and schemas; more complex APIs can use these composition tools, but they remain opt-in. Additionally, OpenAPI’s strict schema definitions create a predictable model – any client generator or linter knows exactly what to expect, which ties back to having a formal schema for our DSL. We also see an ecosystem benefit: because OpenAPI is standardized, many tools (documentation generators, server stubs, client SDK generators) can operate on it. If our prompt DSL is well-defined and expressive enough, it could enable a similar ecosystem – e.g., prompt analyzers, visual editors, or compatibility checkers (to see if a prompt uses features supported by a given model).
GraphQL Schemas: GraphQL uses a schema DSL (typically defined in SDL – Schema Definition Language) that is a good study in expressiveness vs. simplicity. GraphQL’s type system is quite rich (object types, interfaces, unions, enums, etc.), allowing one to model data and operations precisely
graphql.org
graphql.org
. Yet it remains relatively easy to read and reason about because of its consistency (every type and field is explicitly declared). A notable feature for us is GraphQL’s use of directives – decorators on schema elements that provide extra meta-information or cross-cutting functionality. For example, @deprecated marks a field as deprecated. More powerfully, custom directives can be used (with supporting code) to implement behaviors like authorization checks on fields, rate limiting, etc. These schema directives act like middleware or aspects for the API, enabling cross-cutting concerns to be handled declaratively in the schema
gqlgen.com
gqlgen.com
. For instance, a custom @auth(role: "admin") directive on a field could trigger an auth check in the resolver logic, all configured in the schema rather than in each resolver function. This concept can inspire our prompt DSL to include similar hooks – perhaps an ability to mark certain prompt sections with tags like “sensitive” or “formal”, which the runtime or model wrapper could interpret to adjust handling (like applying extra content filtering or style). GraphQL also emphasizes strong tooling: given a schema, you get validation, autocompletion in IDEs, and consistent error messages if a query doesn’t match the schema. A DSL for prompts could likewise benefit from a strong type-like system: e.g., categories of prompt variables (plaintext vs code vs JSON) to catch errors (maybe warn if you put a code block where only plain text is allowed, etc.). In short, GraphQL demonstrates a successful balance of declarative rigor (it’s strict and typed) with developer ergonomics (the SDL is readable and there are mechanisms for reuse and cross-cutting annotations).
Other Notable DSLs (Ansible, Terraform, etc. Summarized): Common threads among these case studies: They all have a clear core syntax (be it YAML or a custom format) that favors humans (readability, logical structure)
scalr.com
scalr.com
, they support composition/abstraction (modules, roles, refs, includes) to manage complexity, and they enable tooling ecosystems (linters, testability, code generation). They also treat the DSL as a contract or source of truth (e.g., an OpenAPI file is the API, an Ansible playbook is the automation spec), which is a mindset we’ll carry into the prompt DSL – it should fully specify prompt behavior in a way that others (or tools) can understand without additional hidden context.
4. Prompt Engineering Patterns & Techniques
Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Chain-of-thought (CoT) is a prompting technique where the model is guided to produce a step-by-step reasoning process before giving the final answer. For example, instead of asking directly for the answer, the prompt might say, “Let’s think step by step,” encouraging the model to break down the problem. Research has shown CoT can elicit reasoning capabilities in large models that basic prompting might not
docs.spring.io
. In practice, CoT often means the prompt includes examples of a reasoning chain, or instructs the model to produce a reasoning line (sometimes hidden from the user in evaluation). For our DSL, supporting CoT might involve an ability to mark certain sub-prompts as “scratchpad” or reasoning steps that the model should output (or follow internally) before finalizing the answer. Essentially, the DSL should allow multi-step prompt templates, not just one-shot queries. We may incorporate a syntax for a prompt that has a “thinking” phase and an “answer” phase, because enabling CoT can dramatically improve accuracy on complex tasks by making the reasoning explicit.
Few-Shot and Example-Driven Prompts: Few-shot prompting means providing the model with demonstration examples of the task in the prompt itself
docs.spring.io
. For instance, to prompt for translation, you might show one or two example sentences and their translations before asking the model to translate a new sentence. This pattern is powerful – GPT-3’s paper famously showed the ability of models to learn from only a few examples in the prompt
docs.spring.io
docs.spring.io
. Our DSL should make it easy to include examples as structured components: perhaps a section in YAML like examples: that contains a list of {input:..., output:...} pairs. The DSL can help ensure these are formatted consistently (e.g., clearly demarcating the example vs the query). Few-shot examples often require careful formatting (like separating them from the actual query), so a DSL that handles the layout (maybe inserting delimiters or ensuring proper newlines) can reduce user error. We should also consider parameterizing examples – maybe pulling them from an external file or choosing a set based on context. In any case, reusable prompt templates for few-shot learning (like “given N examples, then the prompt”) could be a feature. Few-shot prompting addresses patterns where the model needs to output in a specific format or style: by showing it directly what to do, we lower ambiguity. Our DSL might even allow referencing pre-defined example sets (for instance, a YAML anchor or an include that brings in a set of canonical examples for a domain task).
Role-Based Prompting (System/User/Assistant roles): Modern chat-oriented LLMs (like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude) use role distinctions in prompts: a system prompt defines global behavior or persona, then a user prompt asks a question, and an assistant prompt is the model’s answer. Our DSL should explicitly support this structure – perhaps fields like system:, user:, assistant: in the YAML to organize content. The system prompt can set the stage: e.g., “You are an expert coding assistant...” or establish high-level instructions (as seen in API docs, the system message is used to steer tone and constraints)
docs.spring.io
docs.spring.io
. User prompts are the actual questions or tasks. By separating these, the DSL ensures that long-term instructions (system-level) aren’t accidentally intermingled with the user query. Additionally, in complex multi-turn scenarios, the DSL might allow sequences of messages (like an array of messages each with a role). This enforces a clear dialogue structure, making it easier to do things like keep context or do role-based prompting (e.g., we could simulate a back-and-forth chain-of-thought by alternating role messages, or have the DSL supply a hidden assistant “thought” message that’s not shown to user). Essentially, role separation is crucial for instruction hierarchy: system instructions > (then user prompt) > assistant response format. We’ll build that hierarchy into the DSL syntax explicitly, so it’s easy to understand and manipulate.
Context Injection and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Often, prompt engineering involves injecting relevant context (for instance, pulling snippets from documents related to a user’s query). Our DSL could interface with retrieval systems: e.g., allow a section like context: where you can specify external text to include (or even a query to fetch it). While the retrieval itself might happen outside the DSL (in some pipeline), the DSL should be able to represent that context as part of the prompt. This might be as simple as having a placeholder that gets replaced with retrieved text, or as structured as listing documents. The DSL’s role is to ensure the final composed prompt includes everything in the right place (e.g., a system message: “Here are relevant excerpts: ... [docs] ... Now answer the question”). By making context injection first-class, we allow dynamic prompts that incorporate external knowledge while still being declarative. This addresses one of the “imperative vs declarative” questions: we likely want mostly declarative (static YAML), but with hooks for imperative data (like retrieved content) to slot in. Therefore, the DSL might support templated fields that are filled at runtime. In doing so, it still enables versioning and testing – one can test the prompt template with sample context. RAG is a powerful technique to keep prompts grounded; our DSL supporting it means users can focus on what context to use (maybe by reference ID) rather than how to format it each time.
Prompt Templates and Reusable Components: We touched on examples and context placeholders – more generally, the DSL should treat prompts somewhat like functions or templates with parameters. E.g., define a prompt structure with slots for <USER_QUESTION> and <KNOWLEDGE_SNIPPET>, and at runtime those get filled. This is akin to how one might manually do string templating for prompts today, but formalized. We can draw from how Ansible uses Jinja2 templates, or how Terraform variables are injected. A strong schema for this prevents injection mistakes (perhaps the DSL can ensure that inserted text is properly escaped or truncated to fit token limits). Reusable components could mean the DSL allows including one prompt within another (like a reference to a common sub-prompt). For example, suppose many prompts need a boilerplate disclaimer – instead of copying it everywhere, have a YAML node that refers to a central definition of that disclaimer. This reduces maintenance overhead and errors. It’s similar to how OpenAPI $ref works for schemas
swagger.io
, or how Terraform uses modules.
Conditional or Branching Prompts: Sometimes prompt flows can be dynamic (if user asks X, do Y prompt; if Z, do W prompt). While a full programming model might be beyond a simple YAML DSL, we might consider some lightweight conditional support or at least allow the DSL to be used in a larger imperative pipeline (e.g., a Python script picks which prompt YAML to load based on context). Possibly, though, we could allow conditions in the YAML itself (like an if: field). For example, one might have a parameter like tone: formal|casual and have parts of the prompt vary accordingly. This edges into logical scripting, which YAML is not naturally suited for. We could also solve it by encouraging composition: have two YAML files, one for formal, one for casual, and choose between them. Given the directive to maintain declarative simplicity, it might be wiser to handle branching outside the DSL and keep the DSL files themselves straightforward. Still, documenting a pattern for it (like “you can split prompts and use your programming language to pick one”) could be part of best practices.
Meta-instructions and Output Controls: Prompt engineering often involves instructing the model how to answer: e.g., “Answer in JSON,” “Use at most 3 sentences,” “Use temperature=0 for deterministic output.” Our DSL can separate pure prompt text from these meta-parameters. We can have fields in YAML for model settings (temperature, max tokens, etc.), which are not part of the prompt text but control generation. For instance, in the Spring example, they set temperature=0.1 for deterministic classification
docs.spring.io
 – in our YAML, that would be an attribute, not something you’d manually write in the prompt text. Similarly, stop sequences or regex validators for output could be specified. By pulling these out into config, we give users a higher-level handle on output formatting without cluttering the prompt with “(Please answer in JSON)”, unless we want the model to explicitly see that instruction. Some patterns like “chain-of-thought with self-consistency” require multiple outputs; others like “Constitutional AI” add an extra reflection step. While advanced, we should keep the DSL extensible for such patterns (maybe allowing a list of prompts to run sequentially with different roles or instructions in between).
Evaluation Hooks and Testing: A unique advantage of formalizing prompts is the ability to attach evaluation criteria. For example, one could specify in the DSL expected key words in the answer (for automated checking), or integration with evaluation scripts (like “after generation, run it through a toxicity filter”). While perhaps beyond the DSL itself, we can foresee the DSL enabling a testing ecosystem. For instance, if each prompt YAML is an object, we could have another YAML or config listing test cases (inputs and ideal outputs) for each prompt. That enables regression testing – if a prompt changes, you can see if outputs drift. In a multi-prompt setup (like an agent that uses a chain of prompts), the DSL could integrate logging or metrics collection (e.g., count tokens used, measure latency, capture model confidence if available). These aren’t necessarily encoded in the prompt DSL directly, but the DSL’s structure can make it easier to plug such tools in. For example, knowing the difference between system and user messages means you can automatically strip system prompts when showing outputs to end-users or measuring relevance of the answer to the question.
To summarize prompt patterns: decompose complex prompts into modular pieces – role segments, few-shot examples, context inserts, and instruction layers – so that each piece can be configured, reused, or toggled. The DSL acts as the blueprint assembling these pieces. Patterns like CoT and few-shot show that sometimes more text (reasoning or examples) yields better results, which is counterintuitive to those who’d try to keep prompts minimal. Our DSL should make including that extra guidance easy and not error-prone. Likewise, ensuring the prompt is consistent (e.g. if we say “The assistant should respond in YAML,” we must ensure to tell the model that every time) can be handled by one well-crafted system prompt in the DSL rather than repeated manual editing. Ultimately, the DSL should support rapid prompt experimentation: you can tweak a parameter or swap an example and reliably generate the new prompt to test, rather than manually copy-pasting chunks in a playground.
5. Cognitive Ergonomics & Design Principles
Designing a DSL isn’t just about features – it must also be approachable and safe for users (prevent mistakes). Key UX principles we’ll apply include:
Progressive Disclosure: The DSL should make simple tasks simple, while still allowing complex configurations. In UI design, progressive disclosure means showing basic options up front and revealing advanced ones on demand
nngroup.com
nngroup.com
. For our text-based DSL, this translates to having sensible defaults for everything (so a basic prompt definition might only need a few lines), and organizing advanced settings into optional sections. For example, a user shouldn’t have to specify every knob (temperature, stops, etc.) for a basic prompt – the DSL will assume conventional defaults unless overridden. But when needed, the DSL can disclose those advanced options (perhaps via documentation or commented templates). This keeps cognitive load low for beginners (they see a minimal structure) but empowers experts to fine-tune as necessary
nngroup.com
nngroup.com
. Also, by structuring the YAML with sections, a user can ignore entire sections they don’t need (just like a print dialog hiding advanced settings until you press Advanced
nngroup.com
nngroup.com
). We could even imagine tooling that presents a collapsed view of advanced fields that you expand if needed. The benefit is reducing error risk and confusion – novice users focus only on the essential prompt content, advanced users know they can refine further without being constrained.
Convention over Configuration: Borrowing this tenet from frameworks, we will establish smart conventions so that users only override what’s unusual
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. For instance, we might default to a certain role persona (like a friendly assistant) if not specified, default to including the few-shot examples at the end unless a flag says otherwise, etc. If most use-cases prefer, say, a temperature around 0.7, that could be the default in the schema. The DSL should have an opinionated stance that covers 80% use cases with zero config. This not only saves time but also creates a predictable mental model: users learn the defaults and trust the DSL to fill in the blanks in a reasonable way. Only when they have specific needs do they provide explicit config, which the DSL of course allows. This aligns with the idea of sensible defaults and the principle of least astonishment – things should work in the common-sense way unless told otherwise
en.wikipedia.org
. A side effect is fewer decisions to make (less analysis paralysis about what value to choose for every field), which is important when designing prompts (there are already many unknowns in how the model will behave; the DSL shouldn’t add more uncertainty).
Clear Hierarchy and Consistency: The DSL syntax and structure must be internally consistent to aid the user’s mental model. That means using predictable naming for fields and a clear hierarchy that mirrors the conceptual model of a prompt. For example, if we have system, user, assistant sections, that’s immediately meaningful because it matches chat roles. If we have an examples list, each item should perhaps have sub-fields like input: and output: – consistently named in every prompt. By keeping names self-explanatory and avoiding context-specific overloaded meanings, users can apply knowledge from one part of the DSL to another. A consistent hierarchy also means that composition/inheritance is understandable: e.g., if prompt B “extends” prompt A, users should know exactly how (maybe it inherits all fields but overrides some values – analogous to how Docker Compose or OpenAPI allOf works). Whatever rules we choose, they will be documented and minimal. This reduces user errors because the chance of misunderstanding the structure is lower. It also improves learnability – someone can glance at a DSL file and, due to logical sectioning and naming, deduce what’s happening (similar to how one can read a Terraform file and guess the resource relationships by structure).
Schema Validation and Error Prevention: One advantage of a DSL over free-form prompts is we can validate it. By defining the DSL in terms of a JSON/YAML schema or similar, we ensure that many errors are caught early. For instance, if a user puts an integer where a list of examples is expected, the schema validator can flag that before the prompt is ever run. This is akin to type checking in programming – it catches misuses of the DSL. Additionally, we can enforce constraints like “either assistant content must be empty (since model will fill it) or some rule about lengths. Clear error messages from the validator (e.g., “examples[2].output is missing” or “unrecognized field ‘temperatur’ (did you mean temperature?)”) will guide users to fix mistakes quickly. This is much better than a silent failure or, worse, the model receiving a malformed prompt leading to unpredictable output. Error prevention can also be baked into design: by offering templates or CLI tools to generate scaffolding, users start from a correct structure. We might provide snippet libraries (like “generate a new prompt file with all sections stubbed out”). Moreover, certain logical errors – e.g., forgetting to include the user question in the final composed prompt – could be flagged by lint rules (for example, a linter could warn if the prompt template doesn’t contain any placeholder for user input). By integrating these checks, we ensure that using the DSL is safer than ad-hoc prompting, much like how using a compiler with good errors is safer than writing assembly. Our goal is that the DSL fails fast and informatively when used incorrectly, and is hard to misuse inadvertently.
Mental Model and Documentation: We want users to form a correct mental model of how prompts are constructed and executed from the DSL. This requires good documentation and possibly visualization. For instance, we might document a flow: DSL file -> rendered prompt -> LLM response -> post-processing. If the user understands that, they can predict what changes in the DSL will do. Ensuring the design aligns with users’ expectations (no “magic” hidden behavior) is critical to avoid frustration. For example, if the DSL automatically inserts a system message like “You are ChatGPT…”, we must be transparent about it; otherwise the user might be confused why the model behaves a certain way. Ideally, the DSL should be explicit about all important parts of the prompt (even if using defaults), or at least the documentation should clearly state the defaults. In cognitive terms, we’re reducing the gap between the “system model” and the “user model” – they should match as closely as possible.
Limitations of YAML & Possible Workarounds: YAML is chosen for human-friendliness, but it has limitations (no inherent programming logic, indentation sensitivity, etc.). We will work within these constraints by leveraging YAML’s strengths (hierarchy, anchors for reuse, etc.) and not trying to force it to do things it’s not good at (for heavy logic, we might allow embedding a small script or recommending using the DSL with a host language). Simplicity is key: if a user finds themselves needing a loop or function in the DSL, perhaps the prompt needs to be refactored or the logic moved to pre-processing outside the YAML. We’ll document patterns like using Jinja2 or a preprocessor if absolutely needed, but our aim is to make the DSL cover most use cases declaratively. In trade-off, some advanced prompt behaviors might not be fully declarative – that’s a conscious decision to keep the core DSL simpler (progressive disclosure: the truly complex flows can still be done by advanced users using the DSL plus a scripting layer, rather than complicating the DSL for everyone).
Enabling Tooling Ecosystem: By designing along these principles, we set the stage for an ecosystem of tools: GUI prompt builders that manipulate YAML, version control diff viewers that highlight changes in prompts, libraries that can load a prompt YAML and execute it with a given model, etc. This amplifies productivity and reliability. For example, a simple “prompt linter” could check that a YAML prompt does not exceed a certain token length or that all placeholders have corresponding variables provided. Another tool might generate documentation from prompt files (like how OpenAPI can generate API docs). Our DSL, if successful, could integrate into IDEs for syntax highlighting and auto-completion (since we have a schema).
In conclusion, the preparation above has surveyed relevant patterns from software architecture, model fine-tuning, existing DSLs, and prompt engineering techniques. The insights gleaned will directly inform Part 2, where we will design the concrete YAML-based DSL for managing AI assistant prompts and behaviors. We will strive to incorporate the modularity and reusability seen in modular architectures and fine-tuning adapters, the clarity and structure of successful DSLs like Terraform HCL and OpenAPI, and the flexibility and guidance provided by prompt engineering best practices, all while keeping the DSL easy to adopt and cognitively friendly for users. By synthesizing these lessons, we aim to create a declarative prompt configuration language that simplifies complex prompt orchestration in a maintainable, robust way – enabling version-controlled, testable prompt programming for AI assistants.

You said:
You are entering research mode. Your task is to investigate and synthesize insights about how the CALM language (https://calm.finos.org/) and the WASP DSL can be synergistically integrated into an Nx-based, reversible, polyglot AI-Native monorepo stack.

Context:

The project uses Nx + @nxlv/python generator to scaffold hexagonal, reversible microservices in a polyglot monorepo.

The domain model as a contract is inspired by WASP DSL → meaning one specification defines both UI, backend, and infra in a single source of truth.

The goal is to add CALM as a higher-level abstraction — an architecture-as-code language that complements (not reduces) system capabilities, adds reversibility, and enhances design-time guarantees.

What to Research in CALM:

Its formal basis in lattice theory and compositional reasoning.

How CALM defines contracts and semantics for distributed microservices.

Its approach to resilience, reversibility, and system-level synthesis.

Example use cases where CALM sits above or alongside orchestration/codegen layers.

What to Research in WASP:

Its single-contract DSL model for full-stack generation.

How it handles UI/backend/infrastructure cohesion.

Strengths and weaknesses compared to general purpose IaC frameworks.

Lessons from Wasp’s DSL approach that could translate into CALM-driven contracts.

Strategic Tasks for You (the Agent):

Compare CALM’s abstractions with WASP DSL, Pulumi YAML, ZenML stack YAML, and CDK.

Determine whether CALM should serve as:

(a) Meta-DSL abstraction layer above WASP contracts,

(b) Replacement contract layer, or

(c) Complementary system semantics checker.

Propose integration strategies for Nx generators + reversible microservices that maintain cross-platform compatibility (no Makefiles; use Justfiles, codegen pipelines, or DSL → code scaffolding).

Identify risks and blind spots (e.g., CALM’s maturity, developer adoption, DSL overlap).

Recommend best next steps: e.g., proof-of-concept → codify contracts → generator integration → system-level DSL synthesis.

Your Output Should Include:

A synthesis of CALM + WASP synergy.

A diagram (e.g., high-level flow: DSL contract → CALM semantics → Nx generators → polyglot microservices).

Concrete next steps for testing CALM in the stack.

Potential mitigations for adoption risk.

Thought for 1m 35s
Got it, Jackie — let’s go straight at this. Below is a concise-but-complete research synthesis on integrating FINOS CALM with a Wasp-style single-contract approach inside an Nx-based, reversible, polyglot AI‑native monorepo. I’ve grounded key claims with sources and kept everything geared toward practical next steps.

Executive snapshot (TL;DR)
Use CALM as a meta‑layer and semantics checker over a Wasp‑style spec: CALM models architecture (nodes, interfaces, relationships, controls/patterns) and gives us design‑time guarantees and governance; Wasp’s contract drives full‑stack generation. This cleanly separates structure & constraints (CALM) from feature intent & codegen (Wasp‑like).
CALM
+1

Pipeline: Wasp-like contract → CALM model/controls validate & enrich → Nx generators (@nxlv/python et al.) scaffold reversible microservices → IaC (Pulumi YAML/CDK) and MLOps (ZenML YAML) bound as “downstream artifacts,” not the source of truth.
Nx
NPM

ZenML

Formal grounding: While FINOS CALM docs emphasize architecture constructs and policy controls, not lattice theory per se, we can optionally borrow CALM‑theorem/CRDT partial‑order ideas to reason about monotonic workflows and reversibility (explicitly positioned as an extension, not a claim about FINOS CALM).
CALM

Communications of the ACM
VLDB

1) Conceptual synergy map
CALM (FINOS) → architecture & governance

What it gives: A language to describe nodes, interfaces, relationships, validated by controls and reusable patterns; patterns/controls are JSON‑schema–based, making them machine‑checkable in CI. This is perfect for design‑time guardrails, dependency rules, and compliance.
CALM
+1

Why it helps here: Your Nx monorepo wants reversible microservices with clear boundaries. CALM’s interfaces/relationships become first‑class “contracts” for those boundaries; controls enforce standards (observability, security headers, versioning, SLO hints) before code is generated.

Wasp DSL → single spec to multi‑artifact

What it gives: A single DSL file that specifies app features (routes, entities, auth, jobs) and generates cohesive UI (React), backend (Node/TS), and DB (Prisma) scaffolding. It’s a proven “one spec → many artifacts” flow that reduces cognitive load and keeps cohesion.
wasp.sh
+1
LogRocket Blog

Why it helps here: We can generalize the “domain model as contract” pattern: keep feature intent at the Wasp layer, and let CALM overlay architecture semantics and policy.

IaC/Pipelines (Pulumi YAML, CDK, ZenML YAML) → downstream

Pulumi YAML: concise declarative IaC inside a Pulumi project file; good for simple stacks or exposing “YAML façades” around richer components.
pulumi
+1

AWS CDK: general‑purpose languages for IaC with composition/constructs; strong when you want programmable patterns; tied to CloudFormation.
AWS Documentation

ZenML YAML: YAML config to parameterize pipelines/stacks with clear precedence rules — great for reproducibility and environment variations.
ZenML

How they fit: Treat these as generated/consumed artifacts driven by the upstream combo (Wasp‑like + CALM). Don’t make them the “source of truth.”

Optional formal lens for reversibility/consistency

CALM (theorem) shows when distributed behavior can be coordination‑free (monotone programs) — a useful design heuristic for choosing patterns that compose cleanly and roll forward/back with fewer global locks. Also links to CRDT join‑semilattices for monotone merging. (This is conceptual guidance; not the FINOS language spec.)
Communications of the ACM
VLDB

2) Leverage vs. brittleness
Where we get maximum leverage

Design‑time correctness: CALM controls/patterns validate architecture models and interface contracts in CI, preventing invalid microservice topologies/configs from ever generating code.
CALM

One spec → many artifacts: Wasp‑like contract keeps UI/backend/infra coherent; the Nx generator graph ensures incremental, reversible re‑synthesis without drift.
wasp.sh
Nx

Downstream flexibility: Generate either Pulumi YAML or CDK code where each is strongest; swap IaC backends without touching the upstream contract.
pulumi
AWS Documentation

Brittleness risks & mitigations

DSL overlap (Wasp vs CALM): avoid duplicating semantics. Mitigation: Wasp = feature intent, CALM = architectural semantics & policy. Establish a one‑way binding (Wasp references CALM‑declared interfaces).

CALM maturity/adoption: adopt incrementally (start as a checker). Keep an escape hatch to bypass or mark controls as advisory at first.
CALM

IaC divergence: Pulumi YAML can be simple but limited; CDK powerful but AWS‑tied. Mitigation: generate either from the same upstream model; keep IaC files regenerable to preserve reversibility.
pulumi
AWS Documentation

Cognitive load: too many layers. Mitigation: tight doc & generator UX in Nx; Justfile recipes to hide complexity.
GitHub
just.systems

3) Where each approach shines (decision heuristics)
Use Wasp‑style specs to express product and domain intent (routes, entities, workflows, auth). If the team talks in features and user flows, this is your “single source” of what to build.
wasp.sh

Use CALM whenever you need explicit topology, boundary contracts, and compliance/policy rules (e.g., “public APIs must enforce versioned interfaces and structured logging,” “synchronous calls across bounded contexts must time‑box and fall back,” “PII never crosses this interface”).
CALM

Choose Pulumi YAML for quick declarative stacks or as a friendly façade around complex components; choose CDK for programmable patterns on AWS; keep both generated from upstream models to avoid hand‑maintained drift.
pulumi
AWS Documentation

Bring in CALM‑theorem thinking for reversibility: prefer monotone, append‑only, idempotent flows where possible; design roll‑forward migrations; isolate non‑monotone steps behind explicit coordination. (Conceptual guidance.)
Communications of the ACM

4) Integration options (and a strong recommendation)
A) CALM as a meta‑DSL above Wasp (recommended)

Flow: Wasp‑like spec (features) → map to CALM nodes/interfaces/relationships → apply CALM controls/patterns (validate) → Nx generators scaffold services using @nxlv/python (and TS, etc.) → emit IaC/ML pipeline YAML as build artifacts.

Why: Clean separation of concerns; governance in CALM; feature intent in Wasp; both version‑controlled; CI blocks violations early.
CALM
NPM

B) CALM replaces Wasp

Not ideal. CALM is excellent at structural semantics/policy but doesn’t focus on app‑feature scaffolding like Wasp. You’d lose the “single spec → UI/BE” ergonomics.
CALM
wasp.sh

C) CALM as a complementary semantics checker (stepping stone to A)

Treat Wasp as primary; compile Wasp → intermediate model → CALM; run CALM controls; warn/fail in CI. This is the lowest‑risk path to adopt CALM and can evolve into A.

Nx generators: Use Nx devkit to compose generators that (1) read app.wasp, (2) join with system.calm.json, (3) validate against controls, then (4) scaffold services/projects via @nxlv/python (for Python) and TS templates.
Nx
NPM

Reversibility: make scaffolding idempotent and derivable from the contracts. Regenerate on change; never hand‑edit generated sections. Keep destructive ops behind just destroy-svc name=... that only removes files known to be generated.
GitHub

No Makefiles: use Justfile aliases (just gen, just validate, just up, just down) and VS Code tasks to wrap Nx targets and keep ergonomics high.
GitHub

7) Advanced patterns aligned to your goals
“LoRA‑style” stacking analogy: compose instructional concerns (security, performance, style) as separate CALM controls/patterns that layer without collision; each control contributes constraints and defaults that the generators honor (e.g., add OpenAPI versioning middleware when api-versioning control is active).
CALM

Reversible topologies: favor monotone pipeline steps (append‑only logs/events, idempotent provisioning) so partial states can roll forward; isolate non‑monotone steps with explicit checkpoints. (CALM‑theorem heuristic.)
Communications of the ACM

Downstream “choice boxes”: for cloud infra, emit either Pulumi YAML (simple) or CDK (programmable) from the same upstream graph; pick per‑environment.
pulumi
AWS Documentation

MLOps cohesion: when a service produces/consumes models, generate ZenML YAML fragments with consistent precedence rules, matching the environment profile.
ZenML

8) Risks & blind spots
CALM (FINOS) ecosystem size: fewer examples than mainstream IaC. Start with checker mode (C) before meta‑layer (A) to derisk.
CALM

Terminology confusion (CALM language vs CALM theorem): keep them distinct in docs; we can borrow monotonicity ideas as guidelines, but don’t claim they’re native to FINOS CALM.
Communications of the ACM

Tooling drift: if teams hand‑edit generated IaC, reversibility suffers. Enforce code‑owners and “do not edit” blocks; regenerate in CI.

9) Concrete next steps (2–3 days of work to a PoC)
Define a minimal dual‑contract

contracts/app.wasp: 1–2 routes, 1 entity, simple auth, one job.
wasp.sh

contracts/calm/system.calm.json: 2 nodes (api → db), 1 interface, 1 relationship + controls (security, api-versioning, observability).
CALM
+1

Nx generator PoC

nx g tools:generator calm-validate → validates system.calm.json against controls/patterns and fails CI if violated.
Nx

nx g tools:generator service-scaffold → reads both contracts, scaffolds a Python service via @nxlv/python + a TS gateway with interface stubs.
NPM

Reversibility

Mark generated regions; add just regen (idempotent) and just destroy-svc name=... that only touches generated paths.
GitHub

Downstream artifacts (optional)

Emit Pulumi YAML for the gateway+db, and run pulumi up in a sandbox to confirm parity with the model.
pulumi

Emit ZenML YAML for a toy model step if relevant.
ZenML

CI checks

Stage 1: CALM controls pass.

Stage 2: Nx generation diff is clean.

Stage 3: IaC synths validate/preview (no drift).

10) How this beats a pure YAML‑only approach
Governed composition (CALM controls/patterns) vs. free‑form YAML that’s hard to validate across architectural concerns.
CALM

Feature‑intent coherency (Wasp‑style) keeps UI/BE/DB aligned — something IaC YAML alone doesn’t do.
wasp.sh

Reversibility via Nx generators and contract‑first regeneration; Pulumi YAML/CDK stay downstream and replaceable.
Nx
pulumi

If you’re happy with this direction, I’ll turn it into a repo‑ready starter (contracts, initial controls/patterns, Nx generators, and a Justfile) and include a micro demo app to exercise the flow. Want me to target Python+TS for the first two services and Pulumi YAML for the IaC stub?

What to produce

A Cookiecutter template (GitHub-ready) that seeds:

Nx workspace and nx.json conventions.

Filesystem layout and directories for /architecture/calm/, /domain/, /generators/, /tools/transformers/.

Initial CALM patterns library and calm.patterns.json.

A justfile with tasks described below.

A translator/transformer tool (can be a small Python CLI) that:

Accepts CALM JSON (or YAML) and emits domain.yaml (detailed domain entities/fields) or Nx/@nxlv generator inputs (project.json, workspace changes, FastAPI route stubs, Docker/K8s manifests) depending on author preference.

Supports the reverse: domain.yaml → CALM (for teams that prefer domain-first).

Uses deterministic templating (Handlebars/Jinja) and outputs a diffable artifact set (no non-deterministic timestamps).

Nx generator stubs and @nxlv/python config that:

Consume translator outputs for per-service scaffolding (apps, libs, ports/adapters, DI wiring, unit test skeletons).

Integrate validate-hexagon and lint-imports hooks.

CALM integration plan:

Where CALM should be authoritative (topology, policies, deployment/rollback metadata, controls, data-classification).

Where domain.yaml remains authoritative (rich domain field types, validation rules, business use-case specifics).

A mapping spec (CALM → domain.yaml → generator inputs).

CI plan:

PR checks: calm validate, translator dry-run, nx workspace-lint, snapshot tests against canonical templates, git diff cleanliness validator.

Release flow: just build → image tag generation (registry), just deploy (canary support), just rollback.

Documentation scaffolding:

Auto-run calm docify or translator outputs into docs/ (Diátxis style), include architecture diagrams exported from CALM Hub.

Examples:

Minimal CALM snippet for a two-service reversible microservice (AuthService + ChatService) mapped to domain.yaml and generator inputs.

Operational constraints & enforcement

All generation must be reproducible. Use snapshot tests and strict templating. No LLM inference in critical generation pathways (LLMs ok for optional developer hints only).

Integrate CALM controls into validate-hexagon Nx executor so policy failures block PR merges.

Preserve possibility for both CALM-first and domain.yaml-first workflows; provide translator CLI and just tasks for both.

Deliver outputs as: (a) cookiecutter template skeleton, (b) translator CLI spec + examples, (c) Nx/@nxlv generator wiring plan, (d) Justfile tasks, (e) CI pipeline snippets, (f) mapping table CALM↔domain.yaml↔generator.

Non-functional priorities: determinism, idempotence, testability, cross-platform DX, auditability (history/diffs for architecture changes), reversibility (clear rollback metadata and runtime hooks).

Here’s the complete hexagonal monorepo scaffold. It’s delivered as a cookiecutter template that seeds an Nx workspace with deterministic generation, CALM integration, and a translator tool. The template keeps 80 % of the boilerplate automated while leaving 20 % open for your domain logic. A single CALM JSON file defines components, relationships and policies; a domain YAML file defines entities and fields; both are convertible using the provided translator. All tasks run via Justfile for cross‑platform consistency.

Key features and files

Feature	Description
Nx + Cookiecutter foundation	The template seeds an Nx workspace (nx.json) with cacheable operations and a default scope. Cookiecutter parameters live in cookiecutter.json (project_slug, author_name, description).
Architecture‑as‑code via CALM	The architecture/calm/ folder holds CALM models (system.calm.json) and patterns (calm.patterns.json). CALM defines nodes (services), relationships and optional controls/policies. Patterns describe reusable compliance rules. CALM gives a higher‑level description of system topology similar to how declarative config files define system desired state.
Domain model	domain/domain.yaml defines services, entities, fields and relationships. You can author the domain first or derive it from CALM.
Translator CLI	The tools/transformers/translator.py script converts CALM JSON ↔ domain YAML. It maps CALM nodes to services, relationships to dependencies and omits pattern details. It outputs deterministic, diff‑friendly YAML/JSON.
Nx generators and @nxlv/python integration	A service generator stub (generators/service/generator.ts and schema.json) shows how to consume translator output to scaffold Python services via @nxlv/python. It’s ready to be extended to generate FastAPI apps, ports/adapters and unit tests.
Justfile tasks	The justfile defines tasks like calm-to-domain, domain-to-calm, validate-calm, generate, lint, test, snapshot, build, deploy, and rollback. Each command calls the translator or Nx tools with consistent semantics.
CI pipeline	A GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs CALM validation, translator dry-runs, Nx lint/format, snapshot tests and builds on every pull request.
Mapping spec & docs	docs/mapping.md explains how CALM maps to domain.yaml and how both drive Nx generation. It details authoritative boundaries (architecture vs domain), deterministic ordering, and how advanced CALM controls/patterns can influence generation.
Example	Sample domain/domain.yaml and system.calm.json show a reversible microservice pair (Auth & Chat). They illustrate the mapping between CALM and domain definitions.
How to use

Unzip the template and run Cookiecutter to create a new project:

pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter hexagonal-monorepo-template
Navigate into your new project and explore domain/domain.yaml and architecture/calm/system.calm.json. Edit either file, then run the appropriate Just task (just calm-to-domain or just domain-to-calm) to sync them.

Run just generate to scaffold services. Extend the service generator to call @nxlv/python for Python microservices.

Use just validate-calm to apply CALM controls and patterns; integrate further controls as needed. The pattern file can encode policies like versioning and logging.

Commit everything to git. The CI pipeline ensures CALM validation, translator determinism, and snapshot tests gate each pull request.

This scaffold provides a reproducible starting point for building a polyglot, hexagonal architecture monorepo with deterministic code generation, cross-platform orchestration and strong design-time guarantees. The zipped cookiecutter template is attached below.

Mapping strategy: Where CALM vs domain.yaml owns what

CALM (authoritative for):

System topology: components (services, infra), relationships, data flows.

Deployment metadata: image registries, tags, canary & rollback strategies, replicas.

Controls & policies: security constraints, data classification.

Patterns & reuse: high-level architecture blueprints.

domain.yaml (authoritative for):

Rich domain models: entities, field types, validation constraints.

Application-level use-cases and input/output DTO shapes.

Route-level request/response contracts (can be generated from CALM-relational interface descriptors when feasible).

Translator role: deterministic mapping rules (examples below) to reconcile the two. The transformer must be idempotent: run multiple times -> same outputs if spec unchanged.

Translator / Transformer design (deterministic)

Implement as a Python CLI in /tools/calm-transformer/transformer.py.

Capabilities:

calm-to-domain --input architecture/calm/service.arch.json --out domain/domain.yaml

domain-to-calm --input domain/domain.yaml --out architecture/calm/service.arch.json

calm-to-nx --input ... --out generators/nx/input/ — emits project.json, workspace.json fragments, Dockerfile templates, k8s stubs.

dry-run --snapshot → writes snapshot JSON for CI diffing.

Deterministic templating: Jinja with fixed sort order for dicts; no timestamps; canonical field ordering.

Validation: run calm validate (using CALM CLI) after transform and before generator invocation.

Nx + @nxlv/python generator wiring

Nx plugin responsibilities (TS):

Consume NX generator inputs (from transformer).

Create Nx projects/apps/libs with project.json using consistent tags (e.g., scope:auth, layer:adapter).

Hook into validate-hexagon executor; register generated project.json for lint-imports.

@nxlv/python responsibilities:

Create FastAPI app skeletons, pydantic models from domain.yaml DTOs, adapter interfaces for ports, basic tests (pytest + fixtures).

Create uv/pyproject config stubs and ruff settings.

Generator contract:

Inputs must be deterministic JSON/YAML produced by transformer.

Generator must support --dry-run producing the same snapshot output for test harnesses.

Justfile tasks

Example tasks (concise):

set dotenv-load := true

# Generate (CALM-first)
gen-calm calm=architecture/calm/app.arch.json:
    tools/calm-transformer/transformer.py calm-to-nx {{calm}} --out=generators/nx/input

# Generate (domain-first)
gen-domain domain=domain/domain.yaml:
    tools/calm-transformer/transformer.py domain-to-nx {{domain}} --out=generators/nx/input

# Run Nx generators
nx-generate:
    npx nx workspace-schematic generators/nx --input=generators/nx/input --dry-run

# Build & test
build:
    npx nx build --all

test:
    npx nx test --all
    uv pytest

# Validate CALM schema & policies
calm-validate:
    npx calm validate architecture/calm/*.json

# CI check: translator dry-run + snapshots
ci-check:
    just calm-validate
    tools/calm-transformer/transformer.py calm-to-nx --dry-run --snapshot=/tmp/snap.json
    git diff --exit-code || (echo "Repo dirty after transform" && exit 1)

deploy env tag:
    # builds, tags, and deploys (use registry metadata from CALM)
    ./scripts/deploy.sh --env {{env}} --tag {{tag}}

rollback service version:
    ./scripts/rollback.sh --service {{service}} --version {{version}}

CI/CD integration (PR & release)

PR pipeline steps

just calm-validate — fail if calm validate fails.

just gen-calm or just gen-domain dry-run — produce snapshot.

Compare snapshots to committed generated outputs; fail CI if mismatch (forces regeneration or review).

npx nx lint && nx test and uv pytest.

Ensure git diff is clean (unless the PR includes generator output intentionally).

Release pipeline

just build → build images for changed services using Nx affected.

Tag images per CALM deployment metadata (registry, tagging strategy).

Deploy with canary per CALM topology.deployment.canary.

Persist deployment graph (mapping of service->image->commit) to an artifact for rollback.

Reversible microservices & rollback wiring

CALM fields for rollback (example):

"deployment": {
  "reversible": true,
  "rollback": {
    "strategy": "tagged",
    "registry": "ghcr.io/my-org",
    "canary": true,
    "retention": 7
  }
}


Runtime:

just deploy writes release manifest including service:tag:commit.

Store manifests in deployments/ with timestamped names (immutable artifacts).

just rollback uses deployments/ snapshots to reapply older manifests or image tags.

Safety: include health-check gating so rollback only proceeds when canary fails or manual approval.

Documentation & visualization

Add just docs to run:

calm docify architecture/calm/*.json --out docs/architecture

Translator to produce domain docs: just gen-domain && tools/calm-transformer/transformer.py docify

Commit docs or publish to GitHub Pages/Docusaurus.

CALM Hub: provide instructions to upload JSON to CALM Hub for interactive review; include exported PNG/SVG diagrams as CI artifacts.

Example mapping (small snippet)

CALM (simplified):

{
  "name": "ai-app",
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "auth", "type": "service", "language": "python", "image": "ghcr.io/my-org/auth:latest" },
    { "id": "chat", "type": "service", "language": "python", "image": "ghcr.io/my-org/chat:latest" }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    { "from": "chat", "to": "auth", "type": "http", "path": "/validate" }
  ],
  "deployment": {
    "reversible": true,
    "rollback": { "strategy": "tagged", "registry": "ghcr.io/my-org", "canary": true }
  }
}


Translator output (domain/domain.yaml)

entities:
  User:
    fields:
      id: uuid
      email: string
services:
  AuthService:
    language: python
    image: ghcr.io/my-org/auth
    routes:
      - path: /validate
        input: ValidateRequest
        output: ValidateResponse
  ChatService:
    language: python
    image: ghcr.io/my-org/chat
    calls:
      - service: AuthService
        path: /validate
        protocol: http
topology:
  deployment:
    reversible: true
    rollback:
      strategy: tagged
      registry: ghcr.io/my-org
      canary: true


Generators then create apps/auth/ and apps/chat/ with FastAPI route stubs, pydantic models, tests, Dockerfile, and project.json.

Policies & controls -> validate-hexagon integration

Map CALM controls to validate-hexagon checks. Example:

CALM control: any relationship to auth service must be TLS.

validate-hexagon executor reads CALM & project metadata to verify code/infra (e.g., check service configs, ingress rules).

Add calm-validate to Nx pre-commit/lint step so PRs fail early.

Testing & determinism

Snapshot tests: translator produces canonical snapshots recorded in tests/generator_snapshots/. CI compares pass/fail.

Idempotence tests: run transformer twice; assert outputs are identical.

Policy tests: example architecture patterns validated by calm validate and unit tests for generator outputs.

Risks, edge cases & mitigations

Schema mismatch (CALM vs domain.yaml)

Mitigation: define a canonical mapping spec (JSON Schema) and include translator tests that cover edge cases. Fail PRs where mapping is ambiguous.

Type-system friction (TS Nx vs Python)

Mitigation: keep generator inputs language-agnostic JSON; @nxlv/python consumes strictly Python-relevant parts; Nx remains orchestrator.

Non-deterministic generation (timestamps etc.)

Mitigation: enforce deterministic templating; remove generated timestamps; snapshot testing.

Excessive scope creep adding dynamic wiring

Mitigation: start with CALM for topology & policies only; expand translator capabilities iteratively.

Operational complexity in rollback

Mitigation: store immutable deployment manifests and require health-check gating/manual approval for dangerous operations.

Next actionable artifacts I can produce now (pick any)

Draft the canonical CALM ↔ domain.yaml mapping JSON Schema.

Create the transformer CLI skeleton (Python) with a deterministic Jinja template.

Scaffold the Cookiecutter template with /architecture/calm/patterns and justfile.

Draft Nx generator stubs and @nxlv/python sample generator inputs for AuthService + ChatService.

Write CI workflow YAML snippets integrating calm validate, snapshots, and Nx test steps.

Final alignment check (short)

You wanted CALM to add a higher-level abstraction without reducing capabilities — done: CALM is authoritative for topology, controls, and deployment metadata; domain.yaml remains for deep domain concerns; translator makes them interoperable. Determinism, testability, and reversibility are enforced via translator design, snapshot tests, CALM validation in CI, and just orchestration.

Pick one artifact from the actionable list and I’ll generate it right away (e.g., transformer CLI skeleton + deterministic Jinja templates, or mapping JSON Schema).

Create a complementary meta prompt to prime the context of the Agent I will provide that prompt to in its research mode and anything else advantageous to have in immediate context for that prompt. Refine this prompt then respond to the improved
ChatGPT said:

Got it — you want a meta prompt that primes an agent in research mode so it understands how to analyze CALM in relation to your architecture-as-code stack (domain-driven, Nx, Hexagonal, Justfile orchestration, WASP-inspired DSL, etc.), and sets it up to explore synergies without dumbing down or limiting your system.

Here’s the refined complementary meta prompt I’d suggest:

🧭 Complementary Meta Prompt (Research Mode)

You are an AI Agent in deep research and synthesis mode.
Your task is to analyze and contextualize the CALM DSL
 in relation to an existing AI Native PDK stack that integrates:

Nx + Hexagonal architecture (multi-context, domain-driven, with ports & adapters).

Domain models as contracts, inspired by the WASP DSL.

@nxlv/python generator for Python scaffolding.

Justfile orchestration for cross-platform reproducibility (replacing Makefile).

A pipeline toward architecture-as-code, where specifications generate real code and infra.

Your Role

Treat CALM as a complementary or higher-level abstraction layer, not as a replacement unless it truly adds value without reducing capability.

Map CALM’s potential integration points across domains, workflows, and system boundaries.

Identify where CALM can improve expressiveness, alignment, or governance within the stack.

Translate CALM concepts into actionable architecture or pipeline extensions that still mesh with existing Nx + Hexagon scaffolding.

When tradeoffs exist, highlight them explicitly with pros/cons and mitigation strategies.

Key Deliverables

Comparative Analysis: How CALM complements or overlaps with WASP-style DSL contracts and Nx Hexagon models.

Abstraction Layering: Where CALM can sit as an additional "architecture-as-code" layer without reducing flexibility.

Integration Opportunities: How CALM might plug into Nx generators, domain.yaml → code pipelines, or Justfile orchestration.

Blind Spots & Risks: Governance, interoperability, or adoption challenges.

Strategic Recommendations: Clear paths for incorporating CALM into the AI Native PDK stack for long-term leverage.

Output Style

Use structured reasoning with tables, diagrams, and comparative matrices.

Provide actionable examples (e.g., CALM snippet ↔ Nx config ↔ domain.yaml translation).

Explicitly call out emergent synergies and potential points of friction.

Maintain focus on architecture-as-code vision.

⚡ Advantageous Context for Priming:

The system’s philosophy: Architecture, domain contracts, and orchestration as code.

CALM should be treated as a lens and complement, not a constraint.

The output will directly influence meta prompt revisions for downstream autonomous agents.

Worked for 2 minutes
I’ve prepared a comprehensive overview of how the new requirements should enhance the monorepo template and how the architecture-as-code approach, CALM integration, generator wiring, and justfile tasks should fit together. Due to time constraints, I couldn’t implement all the proposed changes directly into a new zip, but the existing template and the detailed plan below provide a clear blueprint for further work.

Key Enhancements Needed
Restructure Template

Move existing template into a cookiecutter-template/{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/ directory.

Inside that folder, create subdirectories:

architecture/calm with patterns/ and microservice-pattern.json.

domain with domain.yaml.

generators/nx and generators/nxlv-python for distinct generator inputs.

tools/calm-transformer containing the transformer.py CLI.

Translator CLI

Expand CLI to support: calm-to-domain, domain-to-calm, calm-to-nx, dry-run --snapshot.

Ensure deterministic outputs (sorted keys, no timestamps) and mapping between CALM topology (services, relationships) and domain.yaml (entities, routes).

Initial CALM Patterns & Schema

Include a calm.schema.json for validating CALM files.

Provide a starter microservice-pattern.json demonstrating how to encode security policies, rollback metadata, and canary deployments.

Justfile Tasks

Add tasks for gen-calm, gen-domain, nx-generate, build, test, calm-validate, ci-check, deploy, and rollback, following the example.

CI/CD Pipeline

Update .github/workflows/ci.yml to run CALM validation, translator dry-run with snapshot checks, Nx lint/test, and ensure cleanliness of generated code.

Mapping Spec & Docs

Create documentation that explains where CALM is authoritative (topology, policies, deployment metadata) and where domain.yaml remains authoritative (entities, validation rules).

Provide example mapping from a simple CALM architecture to domain.yaml and Nx generator inputs.

Reversibility & Rollback

Use CALM deployment metadata to support deterministic rollbacks (tagged images, canary strategies).

Include script placeholders (scripts/deploy.sh, scripts/rollback.sh) and document how to integrate them into just tasks and CI.

Existing Template Download
The current template zip file remains available here: hexagonal-monorepo-template.zip Use it as the baseline for implementing the enhancements described above.

Next Steps
Unzip the template and apply the structural changes outlined above.

Update the translator script to handle bidirectional conversion between CALM and domain specifications.

Refine the generator stubs and justfile tasks to ensure deterministic, reproducible builds.

Validate the CALM patterns using the CALM CLI and integrate it into CI checks.

This plan should help you evolve the template into a fully deterministic, hexagonal architecture monorepo scaffold that supports both CALM-first and domain-first workflows. Let me know if you’d like me to focus on implementing any specific component first.

Highlights of this integrated tree

Architecture-as-code: CALM files in architecture/calm/ define the system topology, relationships, deployment metadata, and reusable patterns. These are authoritative for architecture decisions.

Domain model: domain/domain.yaml remains authoritative for detailed entity fields, validation rules and domain-specific behaviour.

Generator wiring: Translator outputs (in JSON/YAML) feed the Nx generators in generators/nx/ and the @nxlv/python config in generators/nxlv-python/ to scaffold services, ports/adapters, tests and Docker/K8s manifests deterministically.

Prompt management: The .github folder contains a comprehensive prompt‑management system: repository-wide instructions, modular instruction components, reusable prompts, and custom chat modes representing different personas (product manager, system architect, etc.), along with Copilot settings.

Orchestration and CI: The justfile orchestrates tasks for generation, validation, build, test, deploy and rollback; .github/workflows/ci.yml runs CALM validation, translator dry runs, snapshot tests and Nx operations in CI.

Documentation: The docs/ directory holds mapping specs, migration guides, and generated architecture diagrams; design-documentation/ contains UX/UI design systems and feature docs; project-documentation/ stores product management outputs (e.g. the PM and architect agents’ deliverables).

This example shows how a deterministic, reversible hexagonal monorepo can co‑exist with a robust prompt‑management system in a single repository, enabling architecture‑as‑code, domain-driven design, automated scaffolding, and AI‑driven prompt workflows in harmony.

You said:
how would the .envrc (direnv) be incorporated? provide an example .envrc including all the variables that would be needed at least. improve this prompt, then respond to improved prompt

ChatGPT said:

Worked for 2 minutes
To make sure I create a useful .envrc for your monorepo, could you please confirm a few details?

Programming runtimes: Which Python version and Node.js version do you want for your services?

Domain specification: Where should the domain.yaml live (e.g., domain/domain.yaml)?

CALM location: Where will you keep the CALM files and patterns (e.g., architecture/calm)?

Container registry: What container registry and namespace should be used for Docker images (e.g., ghcr.io/my-org)?

Database: Do you have a local database connection string and name?

Secrets/Tokens: Will you need API keys or tokens (e.g., GITHUB_MCP_TOKEN, OPENAI_API_KEY) configured at runtime?

Knowing this helps set up a comprehensive .envrc, but here is an example you can adapt:

Example .envrc
# Activate Python and Node versions
# These helpers come from direnv and automatically set PATH, VIRTUAL_ENV, etc.
# Adjust to match your actual versions.
use python 3.11
use node 24

# General project paths
export DOMAIN_FILE="$PWD/domain/domain.yaml"
export CALM_FILE="$PWD/architecture/calm/system.calm.json"
export CALM_PATTERNS_DIR="$PWD/architecture/calm/patterns"

# Docker image registry and namespace
export DOCKER_REGISTRY="ghcr.io/my-org"

# Nx Cloud settings (optional)
export NX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN=""
export NX_CACHE_ENABLED="true"
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=4096"

# Python packaging settings
export PYTHONUTF8="1"
export PIP_INDEX_URL="https://pypi.org/simple"

# Application environment settings
export APP_ENV="development"
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb"
export REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"
export SECRET_KEY="replace_with_a_real_secret"

# Tokens for external services (replace with actual values or use direnv's allowlist for secrets)
export GITHUB_MCP_TOKEN=""
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""

# Timezone for reproducible builds/tests
export TZ="UTC"

# (Optional) disable Nx daemon for deterministic builds
export NX_DAEMON="false"

# Optionally add other environment variables required by your generators or frameworks
# export CUSTOM_VAR="value"
How it’s incorporated:
Place this .envrc at the root of your repository. When direnv is installed and allowed (run direnv allow once), it automatically loads these variables into your shell. The use python and use node directives set up the correct runtimes. All paths are relative to the repository root so team members can clone the repo and have a consistent environment. Adjust values like DATABASE_URL, tokens, and registry name to match your actual setup.

Below is a refined version of your request, followed by the delivered assets:

Refined Request (Improved Prompt)
Task: Extend the monorepo scaffold to include an example .envrc file, custom Cookiecutter hooks for validation, and a root-level README.md explaining how to run the Cookiecutter template and what is generated.

Requirements:

Environment configuration: Provide a sample .envrc (compatible with direnv) containing all essential environment variables (e.g. Python and Node versions, paths to domain.yaml and CALM files, container registry, database URL, API tokens, etc.).

Cookiecutter hooks:

pre_gen_project.py: validate cookiecutter context (e.g. check project_slug naming, ensure required variables are set) before generation.

post_gen_project.py: run after generation to perform any final checks or display setup instructions.

Project documentation: A README.md at the repository root that instructs developers on how to run the Cookiecutter template, set up the environment (e.g. install direnv, Python, and Node), and describes the directory structure and primary generated files.

2. hooks/pre_gen_project.py
This pre-generation hook validates naming conventions and required variables before Cookiecutter renders the template. If validation fails, it prints an error and exits with status 1.

# hooks/pre_gen_project.py
import os
import re
import sys

def fail(msg):
    print(f"\n[pre_gen_project] Error: {msg}\n")
    sys.exit(1)

# Validate project_slug: must start with a letter and contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, or underscores.
slug = '{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}'
if not re.match(r'^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_-]+$', slug):
    fail(
        f"Invalid project_slug '{slug}'. "
        "It must start with a letter and contain only letters, digits, hyphens, or underscores."
    )

# Ensure PROJECT_NAME and PROJECT_DESCRIPTION env vars are present (used in post-gen README)
for var in ("PROJECT_NAME", "PROJECT_DESCRIPTION"):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        fail(f"Required environment variable {var} is missing. "
             "Set it in your .envrc or shell before running Cookiecutter.")

# You can add further checks here (e.g. ensuring no reserved keywords, verifying Git config, etc.)

print("[pre_gen_project] Validation successful. Proceeding with project generation...")
Usage: Cookiecutter automatically executes this hook before generating files. If validation fails, generation stops.

3. hooks/post_gen_project.py
After generation, this hook summarizes what was created and gives next steps. It can be extended to run additional scripts (e.g. translator dry-run).

# hooks/post_gen_project.py
import os

project_slug = '{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}'
project_name = os.environ.get('PROJECT_NAME', project_slug)
project_description = os.environ.get('PROJECT_DESCRIPTION', '')

print("\n[post_gen_project] Generation complete!")
print(f"Project name: {project_name}")
print(f"Description:  {project_description}\n")

print("Next steps:")
print("1. Run 'direnv allow' (if not already) to load environment variables from .envrc.")
print("2. Install dependencies: npm install (for Nx) and pip install -r requirements.txt (if applicable).")
print("3. Use 'just gen-domain' or 'just gen-calm' to convert domain.yaml or CALM files into Nx generator inputs.")
print("4. Run 'just nx-generate' to scaffold services with Nx and @nxlv/python.")
print("5. See README.md for additional commands and workflow details.\n")
4. Root-level README.md
An example README to help developers get started with your Cookiecutter template:

# {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}

## Overview

This repository is generated from a Cookiecutter template that combines:

- **Nx** for monorepo orchestration.
- **@nxlv/python** to scaffold Python services (FastAPI, Pydantic, tests).
- **CALM** for architecture-as-code (system topology, patterns, and deployment metadata).
- **Domain model** defined in YAML (`domain/domain.yaml`).
- **Justfile** for cross-platform commands.
- **Prompt management** (copilot instructions, chat modes, prompt templates).

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 (install via `pyenv` or your system package manager).
- Node.js 24.
- Cookiecutter (`pip install cookiecutter`).
- Direnv (`brew install direnv` or your OS package manager).
- Optional: Nx CLI (`npm install -g nx`), Git.

## Running the template

Clone or download this repo, then generate a new project:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:your-org/your-template-repo
# You will be prompted for project_slug and other values.
Once generated:

Load environment variables: Use direnv in the project root.

direnv allow
Install dependencies:

npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if applicable
Generate code: Use the provided tasks in justfile:

just gen-domain converts domain/domain.yaml into Nx generator inputs.

just gen-calm converts architecture/calm/*.json into Nx inputs.

just nx-generate scaffolds services using Nx and @nxlv/python.

Validate architecture:

just calm-validate
Run tests:

just test
Build and deploy (if configured):

just build
just deploy env=staging tag=v0.1.0
Generated Layout
When you run the generator, you will see a structure like:

architecture/
  calm/             # CALM model, patterns, schema
domain/
  domain.yaml       # Domain definitions (entities, fields, validation)
generators/
  nx/               # Nx generator inputs (project.json)
  nxlv-python/      # Python service scaffolding config
tools/
  calm-transformer/ # CLI to convert between CALM and domain specs
apps/               # Generated applications
libs/               # Shared domain and adapter libraries
.github/            # Copilot instructions, prompts, chat modes, CI workflow
.vscode/            # VSCode settings (prompt discovery, trust, MCP config)
justfile            # cross-platform tasks (generate, build, test, deploy)
.envrc              # environment variables loaded via direnv
Please refer to the docs/ directory for a mapping spec between CALM, domain.yaml, and generator inputs, and for additional guides on prompt management and design documentation.

Enjoy building with a reproducible, deterministic monorepo!

These assets—`.envrc`, the Cookiecutter hooks, and the root `README.md`—should help your team enforce environment consistency, validate template inputs, and understand how to run and use the scaffolding effectively. Adjust values and extend the hooks to match your specific project’s policies or workflow.
